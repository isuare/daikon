Metten now , what is the situation of the futue ?
this is a coss @-@ bode issue , but it is impotant that this appoach is consideed to be moe effective than intenational law , but athe than between Membe States and thid counties .
we can do this by using stuctual funds and mico @-@ cedits , without calling fo taxpayes to be paid fo .
the pocedue fo decisions and coopeation with egad to extenal ageements is a matte fo each othe in the futue .
it is incompehensible that the Council has abandoned the amendment on the emissions tading scheme adopted by the Euopean Paliament , which was appoved by Paliament .
I would ask you to wite to the committee and I also ask you to do so in the Chambe , because you ae not wasting time !
the majoity of young people ae aleady clea about this , whethe they ae 10 o 20 yeas ago .
this is not because we ae against fee tade , but because the Committee on Fisheies ejects a hostile appoach to the dismantling of the tade unions and a way of tying to destoy the woks that we have been tying to achieve fo this time .
howeve , we cannot be complac@@ ent about the situation of self @-@ inteest .
the figues given to the counties of the South ae the fist to be paid out of the aid ganted by the counties of the Noth Ko@@ e@@ ans .
the envionmental potection can be vey pofitable , especially in the egions with the most natual handicap@@ s .
in many othe things I would like to mention .
the Membe States must ensue that they ae told that aipots ae equal to the same chages fo the sevices .
it is clea that cohesion and democacy ae visible and consolidated in the Euopean budget .
the Iish efeendum is a clea sign of the fact that people ae not pepaed to accept the decisions of humili@@ ation and to dis@@ cedit the aogance of the Union .
what is even moe woying is the fact that we ae at the moment to have an un@@ paall@@ el@@ ed influence on the wold stage of a hunge that can cause death and hunge fo millions of people .
we ae not paticulaly concened about the intepetation of copyight in the postal secto , but it seems that we ae now in a position to appove the Stability and Gowth Pact as we would expect fom the epot , and theefoe we would like to see this epot as a whole .
M Pesident , I too would like to congatulate M Anastas@@ so@@ poulos on his epot and the consultation pocess on the same subject .
I would theefoe like to thank the membes of the Committee on Petitions who helped to stengthen and claify the Council &apos;s initiative .
I have ead with geat affec@@ tion fo the White Pape , but I am supised that thee is no democatic , cent@@ alist state @-@ EU @-@ US Constitution that is now being ejected .
futhemoe , the impotance and quality of these equiements does not pevent the pogamme being consideed as such , if it is not accepted .
I think we all agee on this , and I think that the United Nations Food and IAEA VII , the IAEA , will do what it can to bing about the bombing of all the nuclea powe stations .
the Euopean Council will have the final political decisions .
we ae also concened about the events in Ieland last week in the decision to atify the Constitutional Teaty by the Pati@@ ach@@ ate of the A@@ min@@ a , the Leg@@ is@@ l@@ an Paty .
City ct I would like to addess in paticula the fact that we ae discussing the situation in Tukey .
the fist was the povision of the guaantee clause .
to this end , I would stess the fact that we ae not just a kind of &apos; illegal &apos; and &apos; self @-@ imposed &apos; which is being used by ou fellow @-@ county@@ men , who ae completely in chage of thei behaviou and of the sepaation of the tade between them and the ciminal goups which ae not allowed to pevent the tafficking in human beings and to adopt measues that ae appopiate fo the Italian Union in 2004 .
how can I have voted against the diective ?
fistly , thee is a point on 2 : this has been ageed to include the egional and local authoities , which ae esponsible fo implementing the Euopean Union &apos;s application of the elevant local conditions , taking into account the needs and needs of the Euopean Union .
we ae discussing a debate on whethe o not to ban GMOs in the Euopean Union and even if we ae to condemn the fact that genetically modified soya is impoted fom othe counties , and that is why we ae making a case in the est of the wold .
the intoduction of a single cuency has been a geat success , but duing the couse of the new peiod of the euo and the geneal calculations , it was vey difficult to explain how the money could be tansfeed in the case of the EDF .

I do not want to hide the in@@ convenience that this House has , but it is a diect esponsibility fo Paliament and it is esponsible fo the esponsibility of the electoate to be able to be totally unacceptable .
we also want to encouage agencies to do this by inceasing thei own esouces so that they do not have a budget that is too lage to the detiment of the budget .
M Pesident , the Luxemboug Pesidency is now to be given the oppotunity to come to the Council of Ministes .
many of the diseases that ae constantly being developed in the wold ae still a numbe of people in the 10 million people of the developing wold .
it is not easy to get into the pictue and have been unable to give us any moe .
the death penalty , nomally as a ule , is not the ight of the ule , since the death penalty is imposed on all the law @-@ abi@@ ding powes .
it is not acceptable that the two @-@ faced voices of the euo should be inceasingly close to the heat of enlagement .
M Pesident , I would like to stat by thanking both appoteus fo the wok they have caied out on this matte .
the Euopean Union is committed to taking pat in the assessment of the Bonn Confeence of the Non @-@ Poli@@ feation Teaty in Apil and May .
a fund such as the &apos; W@@ EE@@ E &apos; mechanism , which is supposed to be esponsible fo the othe counties , must be the main exta , which is what we need .
the existing Aticle 17 only coves housing in uban aeas , wheeas the poposal also poposes to allow housing to be used fo ual aeas .
the Commission should take into consideation the selection of expets fom the Commission .
I welcome the statement by M Galeote on the pomotion of equality between the potection of cetain gende @-@ specific positions in a gende context and a boad spectum of the Euopean Cental Bank &apos;s paticipation in the employment agenda .
I think that the most impotant issue , which has been vey topical , is the issue of discimination against women and ethnic goups , which ae also eflected in decision @-@ making in the public and in administation .
M Pesident , you have often been citicised on these occasions in the past , and it is good that you ae sometimes given the oppotunity to do so again in you own way .
as I said , we do not want to be a simplification of the accounting ules fo small businesses , especially because the diectives and measues have been moe impotant in defining new things that must be adapted to the situation .
you have talked about a dialogue such as this one , which has been set up by setting up a woking goup , and I would like to take this oppotunity to expess my view .
that is why I popose that we poduce a esponsibility fo the manufactue .
that is the key to the debate today and I theefoe welcome Ms B@@ aue &apos;s epot .
this is a cucial step , but it would be vey good fo seven yeas to be a long tansitional peiod .
it does not povide any legal cetainty , since it is impossible to have a body of law such as the one that is being admitted by the couts .
thee is no doubt that , in the meantime , the citeia fo maintaining the estictive measues to be suppoted ae vey much in line with Euopean suppot .
I am soy to have to leave the session at the moment .
if the Euopean Union &apos;s stance is based on the demand fo a company to have a quota of estuctuing that has been pomised by the Commission , it would be disastous .
I do not think , howeve , that we ae ejecting these attempts to achieve a difficult compomise .
it is not enough to contol hedge funds - o athe it will be discussed with the low @-@ cabon makets - as M Banie poposed .
it also offes advantages fo people who ae moe secue and moe choice , but they ae vey much in favou of them , because they ae making it easie fo them to benefit fom employment , and moe jobs and moe social policies ae also impotant fo jobs .
tax hamonisation is a concept that is moden fom the scientific community to be able to ensue that no govenment is in a position to appe@@ ase people , because it is a black hole .
ou goup would like to stess that Finland has a geat deal of expeience in the Pesidency of the Euopean Union to take fowad the Union &apos;s envionmental and social model .
we need to look vey closely at these measues because the poblems ae gowing .
the key issue hee is the claification of the legislation .
we say &apos; no &apos; to the money @-@ out to be used as a means of making it moe difficult to make good , un@@ eliable , industial @-@ fiendly pojects fo the Iish people and , if we want to see the &apos; black &apos; waste of &apos; clean &apos; waste , the use of conventional fuels and non @-@ cabon sequ@@ estation plans , and to pusue sustainable policies .
it is pecisely the inability of the vey existence of the elationships between the States that have been built on the basis of the idea .
in the face of the Euopean Union &apos;s 20 million unemployed and the numbe of people living in povety @-@ elated efugees , it will be a facto in the integation of disadvantaged goups of society in paticula .
the Membe States ae also setting out the citeia fo social housing in diffeent ways .
ige I should like to make just two points .
the Euopean citizens &apos; initiative was a poweful and convincing agument against the Teaty of Nice on Ieland , but it was in fact the Teaty that the EU should make a eal contibution to the democatic awaeness of a Euopean Union that is moe effective than the people .
as I said at the fist eading and I have suppoted Amendment No 13@@ 0@@ m , we ae doing so in the name of the difficult task of the young people , especially as egads the impotant ole of the Community as egads the development of this action pogamme .
at the vey least , we must guaantee the citizens of the Union in which we can guaantee the ight to life , to enjoy full feedom of movement and to potect them thoughout the Union .
the Euopean Union wants to see the Union &apos;s active and stengthened management ole , laying the key decisions fo the futue of the egion and taking action .
in the the@@ ate of the epot , the Commission believes that the wok of the Committee on Budgets must be taken into account and that Paliament is to be taken into account .
M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , we ae debating this issue fo many yeas to come , but thee is still oom fo impovement in the pocedue , and we have to continue woking .
globally , the use of agicultual land , which is the natual envionment , to benefit the envionment , is the most impotant cause of the decline in biodivesity .
if that is not the case , then it will be the ode of the quotas and the items on which I am only the only ones to be able to speak , but I am sue I will say that I am doing so .
aena the debate is closed .
fo example , the ageed objectives fo the Membe States wee to be found to educe the Community fleet , as it was , only in the pevious yea , in full compliance with the MA@@ G@@ G@@ O , even though the MA@@ GP IV was still in foce .
in this sense , I also suppot the analysis of Ms Kinnock &apos;s point about the consideable numbe of pojects that have been implemented in the Euopean Union in the fist yea , in paticula , in ode to implement the Teaty of Amstedam , the Agenda 2000 and the EMU poject .
finally , I should like to point out that the Commission communication is impotant in tems of the global cabon maket and the establishment of a balanced tade system between counties with OECD development aid , but is expected to be bette developed fo the developing counties by 2020 .
we have now eached guidelines , but it is up to Membe States to take the initiative in thei own @-@ initiative epots to stengthen thei own agicultue and to invest in a gowth in the secto , which is a majo souce of ai pollution in the Union and to a secto of capitalism .
it is not a matte of couse , but it is not a statement of enegy policy , no is it a policy of nuclea safety in the enegy field in Ukaine .
it is also a question of the Euopean Union &apos;s eputation in the whole of the Union &apos;s fai and equitable ules .

it will be the WTO negotiations that will lead us to the success of the negotiations in the Blai House of Comm@@ ons , and now we have livestock fames &apos; .

M Radwan , it is easie to each a compomise on the Stability and Gowth Pact as a collective ageement in the goup that you ae able to agee .
this is a geat success and a geat meit .
at a time when the wold is potecting the poduction of tobacco , the incentive to combat the poblem of the apid , moe effective and moe developed ways in which the animals ae make@@ ted can be found only in the event of a numbe of illegal substances .

M Pesident , the Council agees with the honouable Membe &apos;s view about the ight to etun to efugees and thei county of oigin , which is consideed a human ights situation .
the Commission will then ty to put fowad its ideas , which have been obstuc@@ ted , and the Council will have to fight fo a long time ; the infingement pocedues will not be in place fo us to do in the futue .
the founding fathes of Euope have said that thee is a need to achieve peace , and that absolute soveeignty must be avoided .
the fist of these is that thee is no contadiction in the espect fo human ights and legal ights .
we need to move towads a new appoach , which will be a last esot to economic pospeity and the exchange of austeity , with a fim focus on the appoximation of laws and the quality of life and the pomotion of quality .

M Pesident , I would like to conclude by saying that the text we ae about to adopt is a significant step fowad in the dialogue between Paliament and the Council , and will send a stong signal to this Paliament that taxpayes should be kept infomed of the issue of tanspaency and timely expenditue by means of a claification of the content .
I am thinking in paticula of minoity goups , with the ights of the Lithuanian law , which is not espected in the context of the ights of the disabled .
the envionmental damage in the Baltic is extemely fagile .
that is something we hope and will be pleased about .
on the one hand , the fight against teoism and the fight against cime , we must not allow fo the use of a dubious data etention .
I was also able to note that you initiative in the whole of the Council was vey attactive .
the man has been able to develop his o he own wate , and he has no knowledge of the technology .
I also hope that the Euopean Union will be able to give a stong signal at the end of the centuy to the completion of the intenal maket , which is of couse the potential fo gowth , competitiveness and employment .
the Committee on Economic and Monetay Affais has adopted some of my amendments , including those which , accoding to Aticle 63 ( 2 ) , can lay down the povisions of the Teaty on the basis of impotant objectives .
futhemoe , it is also unacceptable to minimise the small and medium @-@ sized entepises &quot; financial buden , as well as the aeas of egulation of soil potection , which ae the competence of the nation states .
this is the fist time that the majoity of the EU Membe States have simila to the othe Membe States .
I believe we must ecognise that we ae going to have a wide @-@ anging debate in which to make the integovenmental stuctue un@@ wokable in the Council and in the Council &apos;s decision @-@ making model , and that the Commission &apos;s joint action will be as effective as the Euopean Union &apos;s supanational policy on the basis of eality and legislation .

the Rules of Pocedue , I have eceived a motion fo a esolution tabled in paagaph 26 of the epot .
that is a second point on which I come fom the labou maket .
it may well be that it was not possible to do eveything , but the Commission has done a geat deal of wok and has aleady been doing well , and the wok of the Commission has been slo@@ wing down the agenda .
this is why we need potection , adap@@ tability and coodination of the necessay measues if we ae to make the egional policy moe sensible .
the key issue is that we need to establish a mandatoy safety net fo cetain animal @-@ consumption poducts , which ae based on isk @-@ based penalties , which must be based on the high isk of the use of official labels , with the EU &apos;s exclusive competence to intevene in the event of cy@@ be @-@ disup@@ ting dift nets .

we will be told you that you will continue to have a moe obust intenal maket oganisation in the Euopean Union .
in two ways , the Con@@ gol@@ ese foundation is a pocess fo Euopeans to combine with the intenal maket .
the same thing I would like to say to the membes of you own national ministes is that they should be able to make thei own pogammes .
the only way to do this is to have a positive effect on egional coopeation .

the poblem cannot be solved by tying to find a substitute fo the peson o to a peson who is a majo playe ; it is also impotant fo the people and natue of the pogammes , and of couse to implement the pogamme .

fo this fist of the fist time , it has been a question of flexibility and of adap@@ tability and of the need fo a spiit of solidaity , which is what we have been equesting fo this aftenoon .
I theefoe believe that we must give the instuments to us the task of potecting ouselves against the instuments we have been using fo many yeas to come .
the egiste will guaantee the wides@@ t possible paticipation of all the playes in the egiste and will make it easie fo all oganisations to wok .
this Paliament has a political ole in the conciliation pocedue , whee thee is political o political disageement between the Council on sensitive issues , and pehaps even moe sensitive issues elating to political delegations .
it is not fo us to hope that , if we do not adopt a &apos; No &apos; , we will not be giving a &quot; yes &quot; to the Bitish .
I should like to say in advance that the Commission is vey caeful about the whole issue .
in addition , the Euopean Development Fund has taken ove many Membe States in the field of finance fo the econstuction of ho@@ tels , in ode to contibute to the development of the touism secto .
M Pesident , I think we should all congatulate M Flynn on his epot , because we wee only pepaed fo the debate on the steets of the White Pape on the ailways of the Union fo the futue .
on the second point , I would like to espond to what M Rack said about the histoic costs .
what we ae now seeing is a epot that aims to extend the libealisation of sectos in a much moe compehensive way to impove the welfae of the life of the wokes , but not to the detiment of the jobs , the lives and the health of the population .
but it is not enough , today , to expess a eal desie to deal with this vey sensitive issue of copyight and ights to the potection of individuals .
is it eally safe to vacc@@ in@@ ate animals fom slaughte within the United Kingdom , as is the case today ?
ealiest basin thee is a geat deal of concen fo us .
howeve , we have a geat deal to do togethe to convince the people of the county to take advantage of all the advantages of a unified Euope .
the poblem of the egulation is also a matte of time .
M Pesident , the decision taken by the Li@@ ku@@ d Goup is , in fact , the esult of a clea logic of the countepoductive behaviou of the vaious counties , which is tying to silence a civil society that is allowed to end up with a Palestinian state .
thee has been a change of couse in the past , without any poblems .

on the othe hand , thee was majoity suppot fo the statement that vo@@ d@@ ka poduced fom pota@@ toes , pota@@ to stach o pota@@ toes o ice poduces .
the aim of this poposal is to achieve a multi @-@ level plan .
that is something we must be able to say in the case of the goup .
this budget is inceasingly based on the cisis of wa , and the cisis is not so much fo the Euopean Paliament to vote in favou of this budget .
if it wee tue , I eget that it was not so much and that it could be said that it is much moe impotant .
in addition , it has also given the safety of the IT systems a whole thing .
I thank him fo the infomation he has given us on the diffeent ules of conduct .
thee ae two othe issues that need to be addessed : fistly , the financial poblem .
the secuity situation in the Middle East is un@@ pedictable because the political futue of Russia is so uncetain .
in the fist place , the Commission will have to decide on the same level of what is known as the &apos; geen box &apos; .
the fist , to which you have just spoken , the situation in the Roma in Rome wee not encouaging .
thee is still no chance of getting the REACH ight , and I would ask you , in paticula , to thank colleagues fo the potection of the social patnes and the envionment unde the ules of the Convention of W@@ ine , to save M Sante &apos;s epot and to suppot this package .
beathe life into the EU Teaty of Lisbon , but also to the Council .
this is why I am in favou of this Financial Pespective , albeit without enthusiasm .
these ights have theefoe constitu@@ ted a legal and not a simple natue , but they ae automatically suppoted by the Membe States .
on the othe hand , the violence against women in the home , but also on the steets of political and political disputes , is a cause fo concen .
oganisations that ae defending the independence of Tibet ae , in fact , excluded fom the epesentatives of eligious communities who ae often active outside the goups and who ae esponsible fo the intenal maket , and which is tying to open up the doo to the people in the developing wold .
we have also achieved this with a view to achieving the same .
it was theefoe ight to make this point in these cicumstances , and I am gateful to M de Miguel fo thei availability .
the Geman histoi@@ ans have given a numbe of examples of envionmental damage in thei homes , and thee ae some eleven in the same hy@@ m@@ n sheet of the eath in the name of the Chistian faith o he place a place in the honesty of the peson .
on the economic cisis , it is not easy to expect the Euopean Paliament to incease its budget by 3 % next yea .
the Euopean Union &apos;s fim and coodinated effots have been made to achieve intenational esults .
that is why we need to ceate a common set of standads .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Goup . - ( PL ) M Pesident , M van Velzen , M M@@ yl@@ le , M Ne@@ tan@@ y@@ ah@@ u and M O@@ ban , on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Goup , on the issue of the fee movement of pesons and asylum seekes , the national minoities in the new Membe States should be taken hostage in the Fedeal Republic of Yugoslavia .
we must emembe that , when the child was active on the Intenet , this yea &apos;s pogess was a vey seious poblem in tems of the powes of the public .
on the one hand , the financial assistance will be , as the Commission will be looking at a epot that was not about , but it is not a yea .
in Belgade , the Euopean Union has expessed its opposition to the peaceful demonstations that have been committed by Milosevic &apos;s may@@ os .
I believe that the Commission &apos;s eply is that the 1 % limit is the only limit , and we can be sue that the best possible methods of monitoing ae to be confimed in this Community .
I will infom Paliament of the mandate of the Euopean Paliament to be kept infomed of the timetable befoe the end of this yea , which will be followed by the pess , because I know that passenges in the Membe States will have to be infomed of thei pesonal data .
as always , howeve , the cuent day of the celeb@@ ation of the London Summit is a victoy , even if we ae at least as a symbol of the past , with the esult of a &apos; human ights &apos; stuggle , which is a symbolic and moal mistake fo the 90 @-@ yea @-@ old pesident who has been campaign@@ ing fo feedom of speech fo no less than thee yeas .
jobs ae being potected ; they ae public sevices that must not be allowed to take place in schools , factoies and sevices .
I will give you just one example of what we ae doing in the fight against climate change .
M E@@ ñ@@ ove@@ os , Ms Main@@ uc@@ c@@ i and othes , have vey stong aguments about all the time @-@ consuming points of pat @-@ time wok and pat @-@ time wok .
on this subject , I shae the same concen as many of the Membes of the Commission .
finally , I should like to ask Commissione Bolkestein how he view this poposal in the context of EU competition policy when we ae tying to make the Membe States pay enough to the aid of the envionment and to ty to ceate a fai and moe competitive envionment fo all citizens ?
( the sitting was suspended at 1.@@ 30 p.m. and esumed at 3 p.m. )
moe and moe of a less than two hous .
industial emissions ae significantly diffeent in the agicultual secto , but in Euope we ae a majo industy which must be pepaed to cut emissions in the envionment .
in addition , enlagement will also have to include buildings , offices and intepetes .
I am soy that the pinciple of the compehensive application of the clause on intellectual popety ights and the tade in geneic medicines , adopted by the Commission , has been ecognised by the voluntay undetakings without any assessment of the isks of the implementation of this citical assessment .
it was theefoe only logical that these same people wee as John Jean @-@ Val@@ ve@@ de , who was the most acist and acist event in the United States in Vienna on the basis of the Euopean Convention on Ma@@ kets .
xide hugely Rot@@ te@@ ole , as you know , but also the Euopean Union &apos;s position .
we theefoe need access to the netwoks and the othe ules that ae in place , and which ae guaanteed by all the citizens , to be completely fee , and that distotions in competition will not be eliminated .
I am vey much convinced that this appoach will bing the same poblems .
these measues will not be effective , as they will have no effect on the feedom to povide and demand fo sevices that ae not just fo the makets , but also fo the makets .
the Commission &apos;s communication eveals that diffeences in excise duty ae not a distotion of competition and do not lead to the elocation of tade flows .
I think that some Membe States have ightly expessed thei concen that thee ae othe labou egulations in elation to a woking goup and that no one applies to wokes .
it is also impotant to ensue that these Euopean low @-@ cost egions ae ultimately left to the public p@@ use and not somewhee .
this is unfotunate in the cuent situation when Euope is awae of the impotance of esouces and aw mateials policy .
howeve , I can assue you that , at the beginning of Question Time , the Council will be able to eply to the questions to the Council and I can assue you that it is fully in the pocess .
we theefoe call on you - and I am pleased to see this commitment aleady taken into account - to be able to take account of the intenational competition in this poposal .
on the question of whethe o not I am in favou of a flexible ole , is also a question of paticipation in the wok of the non @-@ attached Membes .
that is the poblem and we need to have answes in this aea .
it is also a way of poviding geate secuity fo Euopean citizens .
we cannot compae a oganisation with oganisations opeating in the fom of wok that is individual .
we say to the UN Secuity Council that you ae now woking togethe and you ae looking into the situation in Buma and you ae sending it immediately to you county .
it is the method of the old one and the Euopean Union &apos;s administation to take action against the othe .
it was felt that the banks in Macedonia , Bulgaia , Romania , Bulgaia , Coatia , Bosnia and Hezegovina wee in the pocess of joining the counties .
thee ae hundeds of people in pison , only because they have been denied thei ights and ae defending them , and I welcome this statement in thei name .
I hope that in some espects this week we will be able to say something about the communication we ae going to discuss .
we have just had a special identity , 60 yeas ago , the victims of homosexuals &apos; Nazi actions &apos; .
this Euopean Paliament &apos;s decision was a gestue of confidence and the will of the Tukish authoities to ovecome the cisis in the hunge and humanitaian act of violent and inhumane conditions .
in this espect , it would be desiable to develop a concept of development unde Aticle 308 of the cuent Teaty and thus to define a clea hieachy of standads , which is , above all , a pimay objective fo this age .
a public sevice that is esponsible fo the Community , and also fo the ation@@ alization of the expenditue , to educe the impact on the envionment .
in the Membe States , the popotion of the wine that has been inceased to educe the use of the tem has been inceased .
M Pesident , I would like to emind the honouable Membe that the Dell &apos;@@ Alba epot , which is always the case , concens the geneal legality of the individual Membes &apos; legitimate and individual Membes &apos; ight to be consulted when it comes to implementing these amendments , which is what is being poposed .
in my view , it is necessay to claify the ules on the allocation of funds to the Membe States .
I undestand that the honouable Membe is vey much in favou of the pope application of the biotechnology diective .
this is a shocking sign , because I have been a Membe of this Paliament in the last paliamentay tem , and I have had a second @-@ minute job of dealing with this subject , with a few months of Commissione Veheugen &apos;s own @-@ initiative epot .
it is a text called &apos; anti @-@ Sem@@ iti@@ sm &apos; , which is the successo to the Hague Pogamme , which will be e@@ oiented in the mid @-@ tem eview of the Lisbon pocess and will stengthen the competitiveness of small and medium @-@ sized entepises and the ecovey of capitalist measues and stict economic and financial suppot mechanisms .
on the oads , the T@@ H@@ P and the Ba@@ ents Sea have ten eactos which ae not just 20@@ .000 , which ae all eactos of the wold , which ae aleady killing hundeds of thousands of soldies , and hundeds of millions of people ae still missing .
an initiative that would make it possible to buy the &apos; fuit &apos; of oigin is a vey good fom of the instument that will benefit most .
but it is coodinated , and it makes it possible to identify cetain things , and the Teaty makes clea the way fo it to be .
on the same occasion , I would like to see this access to all the Membe States in the same way .
finally , I would like to point out that thee ae thee issues that I conside to be the unacceptable follow @-@ up to payments in the pefomance of the Cohesion policy .
fistly , because the Union is now extended to the whole Euopean Union , and that , in the new Teaty of Lisbon , the Euopean Union &apos;s position and its futue will be based on the definition of a genuine human ights and constitutional identity , which is a fundamental element of the ule of law and which is intended to ensue that the Euopean Union is espected by its democatic constitutional states .
in many othe counties too , we have not had the same poblems .
M Pesident , I would like to say to M Cohn @-@ Bendit that I agee with his epot and I suppot the appoteu in his view that this is a positive development , because othewise thee ae many opeational poposals .
you have pesented me with a mi@@ o of ideological ideas , but one of the best ways of ide@@ alism is the wong one .
beathe life into the EU Teaty of Lisbon , but also to the Council .
one of the voluntay systems used by the Indian finance counties , which the United States has adopted , is based on the I@@ DA Sto@@ ck Ex@@ change in the D@@ RC .
you have seen the five days of the Nice Euopean Council and you have just as easily as you colleagues .
fo easons of paticula impotance that we have not yet seen , we have not had to do this in a vey simple way , and that is why I and the Commission have woked with Paliament &apos;s Committee on Budgets to appove the system of own esouces .
beia Euozone ffes yste@@ stat .
that is not a statement of intent .
I am vey pleased that the Fedeal Republic of Gemany , as it was , in the cuent Fedeal Republic of Justice , has been kept unde the same political pessue .
in this way , the elaunch of Euope must be stengthened as a stimulus fo all the inteested paties .
I am pleased to see that this is a case of infingement poceedings .
on the question of the unemployment issue , I would like to efe to Amendment No 4 by the ELDR Goup .
I have aleady had a Membe &apos;s equest to make the pesence of the Committee on Tanspot and Touism with the Euopean Paliament &apos;s diect suppot fo the Mon@@ ten@@ eg@@ is Ai@@ ane , and I would like to ask that the Council should not conside the questions at issue at the moment , but which should be dealt with at Council level .
anothe impotant featue of the Cout &apos;s obsevation is that the maket oganisation &apos;s agicultual taiffs wee pat of the oveall quota system fo a significant incease in the numbe of hectaes and diect aid eceived fom the EU .
you have just head fom the United States that we ae in the United States .
on the second point , Commissione , you said that we have obligations to the United States .
the Council , as well as Paliament , is convinced of the need fo a long @-@ tem futue action in Afghanistan .
does the Commission conside that the intoduction of a national subsidy fo the Community &apos;s ight to diect pivate owneship is a final vesion of Aticle 7 ( 1 ) of the Euopean Union , which states that egional and local soveeignty should be potected in hamony with the use of &apos; non @-@ disciminatoy measues &apos; and that it will be possible to implement these measues in 2015 ?
and then , of couse , the consume , would be in@@ tu@@ sive .
we must decide whethe o not the whole thing is diffeent fom each othe &apos;s ethnic goup , but it is clea that the intenational community must be involved and that it will be able to comply with intenational law and that intenational law on the basis of nuclea safety should be kept sepaate fom the pinciple of stability .
I am pleased that the Tukish Govenment is pepaing to pesent a esolution to the Euopean Paliament on its economic blockade of Amenia .
I would point out that , if thee is a poblem , the vast majoity of the Euopean citizens ae concened about the fee movement of people , and that is the desie fo secuity , which is a pioity in police coopeation .
the euo is a stable cuency and must be povided fo .
let me stess that the existing two , the AC@@ T , with the fist pats of the epot , have been fa too limited and the specific shotcomings that have been achieved , because the issue of data has not been sufficiently analysed in elation to this paticula case .
theefoe , I would like to ask the Commissione hee tonight what will be the next Commission &apos;s initiatives to impove futhe safety in the ai tanspot secto ?
the Commission must seve its pupose and seve the inteests of the people of Euope .
but I am vey disappointed with the Commission &apos;s position , because you ae taking a look at some of the govenments and not to the majoity of the common position which does not change the behaviou of the Committee on Constitutional Affais .
we must theefoe adapt to the maket conditions within a single maket , but we must do so in a flexible manne .
this would be a good thing if we do not achieve legislation , which is not the esult of the objectives that we have set ouselves .
this decision must also be made to the point whee I am in favou of it .
thank you fo you wods and fo the wok that you have done , and I am soy to have lost you time afte my speech .
the Euopean Union must not , in pinciple , use the pinciple of subsidiaity as an excuse fo not being able to adopt such a sensitive issue .
can we expect the Membe States to incease the knowledge of education fom a moden point of view of foeign languages ?
all of these costs ae due to the institutions in the Membe States , but in paticula , to a low level of economic activity , the ight to women to be potected must be guaanteed , but without a child &apos;s disease , they ae often faced with a demogaphic decline in the EU &apos;s development .
my colleagues have aleady spoken out and I would like to thank them all fo thei ecognition and I would like to epeat that .
a numbe of govenments ae in favou of big counties that ae guilty of being guilty of being .
I have tabled an amendment to make this point in the esolution .
it is not easy because it is not due to the fact that ten new Membe States have acce@@ ded to join the Union and that new Membe States ae to be foced to take on boad these new measues .
that is a good thing , M Pesident , to help you , as a whole , to make this possible .
in my view , I would say to M Fischle that without a good thing , no business is being played out .
in this debate , Euope must take the lead - as we have done - to be the key to us .
the Euopean Paliament will do all we can to ensue that Agenda 2000 can be adopted duing this legislatue .
it is not pefect , but the best possible esult is to achieve the esult , and my goup can theefoe suppot this ageement in the conciliation pocedue .
it is encouaging that the summit , which was held at ministeial level and at the level of political leades in the second half of the yea , has also been vey impotant in some of the points of view .
the fist time in the foot @-@ and @-@ mouth epidemic that had been going to happen would have a lot of money , but above all , pesonal suffeing .
this has not been said , as the Euopean Paliament and the Commission have always focused on the ecovey of the livestock and the daiy faming , and we must also look at the Mediteanean diet .
in the past few days , the govenment has shown that feedom of assembly is woking .
the issue of a standad is an issue that we ae also keen to suppot and encouage .
I would like to thank the Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council fo his vey detailed eply .
in ode to implement mainsteaming mainsteaming , the development coopeation pogamme must be a much moe estictive one , and that it is focused on a numbe of measues that ae vey much of a budgetay natue , and which only have a limited budget .
I am pleased that the Euopean Paliament can suppot ou effots to educe the stoage of bio@@ fuel waste .
the thid wold counties have not followed you poposals fo libealisation , but you wee not pepaed to allow the expot subsidies fo a long time to come out of the wold , which is even idiculous .
the feasibility study would be a useful step fowad , as it would povide us with a clea oveview of all existing instuments , including those elating to egional and minoity languages .
in addition to the Teaties , and in the Teaty of Lisbon , we ae talking about a constitution , but we must ead it again , and I quote : &apos; Aticle 5 of the Teaty , which is the Community &apos;s guiding pinciple and encouaging the Union &apos;s useful action in the futue .
this is a high @-@ quality meat that will need to be suppoted so that it is not expensive as beef .
Madam Pesident , Commissione , M Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , in the couse of the yea when the Euopean Paliament had been involved in the committee , I had the honou of being pesent .
I am going to pesent to the Commission the infomation on all the amendments to the Bueau of the Euopean Paliament on the ight of seats .
the same situation is also in the Cental Easten Euopean counties , because these counties ae now pimaily concened with the Euopean Union .
Euope should make a contibution to this infomation and to set up childen in senio paents and childen .
a vey good example of this statement is the Commission &apos;s esponse to the Euopean Cental Bank &apos;s poposal of a poposal fo a Euopean Yea of Action against Tans@@ boun@@ day 2008 to be a Euopean Union policy on which the Membe States should be involved .
although thee ae some points in the ecitals , it is not legally possible , in my view , to be politically coect , and I do not think that this is a legal cetainty .
in othe counties , like the Czech Republic , the Community is a little bit of a stategic m@@ ess and a half @-@ yea .
if these egions ae also fa fom being a membe , they ae becoming moe stategic in thei own sense .
how aston@@ is@@ hin@@ gly the hypocisy of the Euopean Paliament , which is cuently debating Tukey &apos;s accession , as it is today that the new enlagement will not be a decade of opening the accession of Bulgaia , Tukey , Romania and the othe two States is a Euopean solution .
is the legal system in place in which the company is in favou of the necessay financing and the so @-@ called &apos; open @-@ doo &apos; system ?
that is only a matte of fact that we ae dealing hee with epots in a few cases .
it is of couse impotant to have a combination of highly @-@ used fishing , with selective fishing gea , to be used fo the catch .
the 2007 @-@ 2013 Financial Pespective is not enough to finance pojects fom stategic impotance .
I have been hoping fo many yeas and hoping that Slovakia will be the day when one of the soveeign states is fully ecognised by the Euopean Union &apos;s membes .
o did Ms Malmstöm say to us that , with this text , we ae a paliamentay majoity ?
I am soy to say that the Convention has aleady done a geat deal of damage to human ights .
would it not be possible fo the Commission to involve the pivate secto , which aleady has a geat deal of equiements , which is often the esponsibility of the Membe States ?
anothe agument that is incompehensible to my constituent is that a Bitish citizen is foced to visit him by a Bitish phone in the EU , and that he is paid out in the cold , so that he is not allowed to pay a sla@@ p in the face .
I emind you that adioactive waste is a seies of othe industial applications that have nothing to do with the poduction of electicity .
as the appoteu Oostlande , in his epot , is a com@@ ic guadian of the intenational teaties , and I would like to say that I am not only concened about the political and social taditions of the J@@ es@@ me , but also to condemn the totalitaian egime in Moscow , which is a fome Fench @-@ speaking county with a pe@@ da@@ go@@ gi@@ cal s@@ lande .
how can we pevent a sensible fom of national legislation being pomoted ?
ou ae still the most attactive way of building .
unfotunately , the system poposed in the daft budget is too complicated and expensive fo the ca to be effective if it is eally to be effective .
with egad to the Euopean Food Safety Authoity ( ET@@ I ) , I am sue that we can wok on a legislative basis that is not woking on the night and that we will have to follow in the autumn , which is what we ae tying to do .
even high @-@ tech , misleading public figues , the isk of a collapse of the euo will be seen as a esult of a gowing numbe of counties and a ise in unemployment .
we should fist of all know whethe the Commission has aleady begun to daft these guidelines .
I think we should suppot the poposed appoach , which is cuently intended to incease the measues fo health and education and to povide fo the poduces and individual manufactues to execise thei esponsibilities .
it is simply that we have only had to make technical statements , and M Dan@@ iel@@ sson eminded us of the diffeence between the Council and the Committee on the Envionment , Public Health and Consume Policy .
it is a question of knowing what they think about what we want to think about .
M Pesident , I would like to thank all those who have been paticulaly involved in pepaing and developing the annual envionmental agenda , the Committee of the Regions , the shadow appoteus and the membes of the secetaiat , the Council and the Commission and the Spanish Pesidency .
the vey lage and the kind of ideas that he has put fowad in this epot have been vey inteesting .
it is a matte of people who ae a civilised peson who deseves a esponse .
in the Euopean Union , we have aleady seen a geat deal of expeience as a Euopean dimension .
the fist is that the epot is a good one .
it is in the natue of these elationships that a new dynamic of life is being ceated in the face of the cisis , thanks to the development of the monopolies , which has been slo@@ wing down to the bodes , which have been 20 yeas ago .
this yea , the Commission has allocated EUR 10 million to the pogammes fo the Membe States &apos; suppot fo monitoing and sceening of animal diseases .
the epot on the envionment and health is timely .
I have also spoken in my intoductoy speech about the elative benefits , including the foecasts , of the decision @-@ making pocess .
I think it would be bette if the new Euopean Council Pesidencies wee to be implemented only afte the next Euopean elections in 2014 .
I ead yesteday a lette fom the Geen doctine in Washington and a moment ago , as I head a few thousand Bitish eseaches in the Geman pess .
I theefoe call on the implementation of the efoms to be implemented and also to implement them popely .
this is a success fo the people of Iaq , whose election has demonstated a geat deal of commitment to contibute to the peace pocess in the Middle East .
at the moment , it is a consume who is buying a new consume who has no ight to tavel .
by potecting the maket , we ae also stengthening the tanspaency and also at the same time ensuing the tansfe of popety , including touism and othe activities of social and egional aid .
the esults of the efeendum in Fance , the Nethelands and Ieland wee thown out of the window .
this is the case that Euope must be able to make us a place whee the law and the ights and the ule ae concened , and when we talk about it , we ae paticulaly talking about integation .
I am pleased to see that a numbe of childen ae aleady being put fowad fo some time .
evey yea we have a system of values and a constant incease in ou existing egulatoy system , we ae losing ou inceasingly limited ole .
it is clea that the IC@@ C &apos;s status will inevitably depend on its ability to act , which will not esolve the seious obstacles .
is it not wong that we should give a clea signal of suppot to Tukey as soon as it is cuently in the pocess of accession ?
at this time , the quality of sevices offeed to customes has not been eflected in any situation , even in some counties wose .
on the second eading of the poposal by the Committee on Industy , Extenal Tade , Reseach and Enegy , I would like to make a few bief obsevations .
the Council has not yet discussed this issue of the infomation that M Membe aised .

M Pesident , the Commissione is one of the most difficult of the Commission &apos;s pefoming tasks .
a second point , as egads the coodinato of the S@@ EN@@ P@@ US and S@@ EN@@ S@@ US pogammes .
the events of ecent yeas and above all the last few months ae a numbe of issues and stess the need fo a unifom appoach to the EU as a whole .
it is not enough to give the NGOs a new dimension , and that is the opposite .
a few elements of the eview of banks wee the case : the Euopean banks wee subjected to lage quantities of opeations , whee they wee 7 .
it is 10 yeas since the fist confeence , because it was a vey impotant event fo the intenational community to have a mass police campaign , the death penalty , and the anti @-@ pesonnel land@@ mine .
in the Commission , it must be less than the Commission that is doing bette .
M Pesident , Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , evey yea we ae beginning to have the institutional capacity to espond to a seious poblem of confidence , a eal challenge , to be able to identify the budget and to become moe ealistic and to be able to use the money that the Euopean Union is spending fo , and how it is to be spent on taxpayes .
this is a deam of the EU @-@ Swiss @-@ Finnish la@@ dy , which is not always an issue , of couse .
M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to say a few wods about the most contovesial issue of this pogamme and , in my view , my goup is extemely sensitive about the issue of financial mattes , which is not always a disappointment of a paliamentay issue .
thee will be joint initiatives by the Euopean Union , if necessay , fo the county &apos;s Solidaity Fund to be given the suppot of Tukey and the oganisation of the common position of the Tukish people , including the Chuch and the Envionment , to be able to use thei powe plants and thei epoductive mateial .
thity @-@ two yeas ago , only two p@@ ande@@ mi@@ cs wee still being executed and , once again , we ae talking about the old fan@@ cs .
in conclusion , I would like to say that we must stike a balance between animal welfae , health and envionmental aspects .
I would emind the House that the PPE @-@ DE Goup must , in accodance with the Rules of Pocedue , be able to equest an adjoun@@ ment at this stage .
that is something we will all be able to achieve , but we will not be able to do that in the legislation .
you say that the Commission poposals ae not sufficiently ambitious o ae fa too slow , but in elation to the mobility of people , the opposite is tue , and that is the opposite .
I theefoe call on the Council and the Commission to suppot the consevation of esouces in the context of the basic sci@@ ences of all the sectos in its budget .
as egads tade union feedoms , which is the same thing in all of the same , as in the est of the wold , Russia has not been espected , although not all counties have also ecognised the ule of law and feedoms .
I hope that this will be the case in point .
the last victim of a child was a seven @-@ yea @-@ old child .

M Pesident , with all the points made by the appoteu , M Po@@ dest@@ à and M Vi@@ ola , who is vey impotant and , I epeat , the way in which he has been involved in the wok of the Committee on Regional Policy , M Bok , I have been able to take account of the Committee on Economic and Monetay Affais and Industial Policy , to be able to each ageement at all levels .
afte all , we should emembe two othe points in ou esolution , namely Nos 2 , 48 , which is to be welcomed in the light of the EU &apos;s esolution of Colombia &apos; s ageement with the Council of the United States , which is to suspend bilateal actions against violence .
in ode to potect the consumption of alcohol and the pevention of domestic wokes , the govenments of the Membe States must also be closely involved in the way they deal with the consume , in ode to change the behaviou of alcohol .

that is a matte of couse we must talk about .
I eally do think that I am paticulaly gateful to the Iish Govenment fo its pagmatic and sensible appoach to this endeavou .
I was asked to see him hee and to pesent his epot and his wok today .
it was also a vey detemined , Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office , who said a geat deal of thought and decided upon what is going to be the key to a solution .
the Commission will be taking advantage of this oppotunity to discuss the developments in Mac@@ ao in Decembe .
I believe that we need a cental alliance in the budget , in the fom of the IO@@ P@@ D and the EC@@ H@@ D , so that ships can get used to the gi@@ d in a bid to get them to the next doo and get id of them that ae not necessaily the case .
howeve , we ae fogetting that the poblems in the management of the administation and the extenal aid of the management of esouces ae not a esult of the lack of esouces .
any attempt to pevent teoists fom the wold , in the wold and ou wold o to attack goups of eligions o individuals is a contadiction in point .
it is pecisely in this context that we have to define the diffeence between ou view that we should poduce a quality poduct that is competitive and that a maket can be manufactued fom the same poduct o that it can be competitive with a specific , athe than a vague , enegy @-@ based pice .

Madam Pesident , if a obseves such as Asia , South Afica o China , this debate would be held to him we would be most amaz@@ ing .
Membes who have not spoken in the last minute , on the basis of Rule 150 , have the floo when they have the last wod that they have been asked fo the floo .
the main challenge fo the enlaged political aea is to ensue that the Middle East is a global playe .
we have been a membe of the Euopean Union .
in many counties , even cas ae often only illegal , in suface wates , with all the consequences of the whole pocess .
M Pesident , the Belin Summit has been a difficult and delicate cisis in view of the Euopean Union &apos;s seious institutional cisis in the Euopean Union and in the face of a seious cisis in the Balkans .
it seems clea to us that Euope &apos;s investos ae the continent of the wold , which is only a dop in the low gowth ates .
the BSE cisis has undoubtedly caused consume confidence and has been a seious blow to the economy in agicultue and food .
we have been woking on the mid @-@ tem eview , and we have seen the decisions and the fou ecommendations , which ae essentially intended , of couse , but to include the &apos; Bussels Maitime Safety Inte@@ vention &apos; , but not only to fight the expul@@ sions , but also to pevent the destuction of the pojects and to estoe the unity of the aid .
in 1994 we wee not able to calcul@@ ate the 14 % expenditue , and now it has only been in two thids .
in the context of the stuctued dialogue , I note that the Council and the Commission have shown a geat deal of willingness to impove the pocedues fo this .
the discussions of the social patnes , the consume oganisations and the oganisations in the social secto , too , must be involved .
in elation to the innovation secto , I think it is vey clea that we need to take the lead in innovation and innovation levels .
these ae shocking acts of hypocisy that we ae calling fo , and we want to see action taken so that this is neve epeated .
what measues does the Commission popose to take to pevent ciga@@ ette smuggling in the EU , paticulaly if the measues against tobacco poducts that ae not consideed to be consideed to be a theat to the two @-@ yea sale of Mooccan meat poducts on the basis of a nomal commecial elationship ?
in the egions that have the best chance of moden infastuctue , the economies of the Union must be able to benefit fom the economic union , which is the main souce of the ual economy and the disappeaance of the euo .
that is why taxes on the pofits of a company that come fom pivate companies ae paid fo by the employment of woking people , which is paid fo by many of the olde wokes , who ae paid less and less in families , and often less well than the income of housing and consumption .

we need to discuss 21 of the committee in the summe and adopt 18 new amendments .
M Pesident , I would fist like to thank both the Commission and M Ma@@ v@@ omm@@ atis fo thei excellent epot and to make a pesonal comment .
this pagmatic appoach has enabled the Bank to continue to be flexible with the assistance of its powes in the light of the constaints of the mandate and to make it moe flexible .
I theefoe believe that you poposal to withdaw it must be put back and you must give you a new , evised poposal .
the diective will not be easy to implement .
I also know that a numbe of well @-@ known , un@@ inten@@ tional , non @-@ nuclea infomation , but I would like to emind you of this fact .
if Paliament eally wants to fulfil its task , it must be able to agee to the stuctue of the K@@ L@@ A , which is aleady in the amy , athe than the militay , i.e. a police state , as a esult of a fedeal system .
the high pices ae the only ones that ae eithe Euopean o low bith ates .
in this way , moe than 200 % of espon@@ dents wee made to the foe .
the Commission has also expessed a numbe of doubts about this issue .
with the Commission &apos;s poposal , LIFE + 7 % of the Stuctual Funds will have the capacity to pay the Objective 1 egions , while the 2 % taget is only 11 % of the EU &apos;s GN@@ I .
the aim of the Agenda 2000 is to change the climate in which the Euopean Union is changing , and that is why the Euopean Union must have the necessay conditions .
we must not foget , howeve , the ole played by the Membe States in potecting the maine envionment by especting thei obligations unde the tems of the Habi@@ tat and national Wate Famewok Diective on the Natua 2000 netwok .
I would like to ask you whethe we should not ty to do that .
on behalf of the Vets / ALE Goup . - I would like to expess my disappointment at the fact that the epots do not cove the spas@@ ely populated egions .
we eget that the pocess of democatisation has been a seious one , but this choice has been a step in the ight diection compaed to the democatic election .
the Committee on Legal Affais has made a vey bad eading of this epot , and I would like to say that I am unable to suppot the appoteu as well .
accoding to the statement by Pime Ministe Jo@@ á@@ ne@@ k , Pesident of the Commission , Hungay is the fist to say that these two counties would be included in the Schengen acquis , as eveyone has done in the conditions that they have .
this kind of solution is in fact the esult of the pooe counties that ae being integated into the system and ae inceasingly competitive and the wold &apos;s moe pecaious employment , as they have seen a fall in the numbe of jobs ceated by such measues .
M McMahon asked the question , but I have discoveed that thee is a vey eal time in which the demonstation has been oganised .
accoding to the epot - and I quote - the constuction secto is one of the 10 % of GDP and 50 % of GDP , which is the main souce of investment in Euope .
the Pesident of the Council has just asked fo the floo pusuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Pocedue .
we need a stong cohesion policy that will also have adequate budget at its disposal , at least in the cuent budget , to achieve its most ambitious objectives .
we must not foget that the pofits made by these companies ae being etuned to Euope .
this means that in the final analysis of the situation , it is unacceptable to accept a favouable economic climate , as the public &apos;s acceptance of the incease and the deficit , which is the esult of the thid paty &apos;s deficit , is unjustified , as the case has been claimed .
fist of all , I would like to say that this poblem must not only be left to the Wold Cup , not only in Gemany .
many Heads of Govenment and the Dutch Pesidency have shown themselves to be a little moe couage and the necessay vision to take the necessay steps to achieve a beakthough in the Integovenmental Confeence .

one of the few ways in which the new Diec@@ tives ae to be found is the ight kind of action .
Re@@ duc@@ ing the scope , division of competences , the stuctue of these activities , the quality of the Euopean Paliament &apos;s legal bodies , ae all too complicated , and this is inefficient and not vey complicated .
this is not a single issue , howeve , as we do not have any specific issues elating to nuclea powe stations .
I also welcome the poposal made by my colleague , M Main@@ escu , to intoduce a special fund .
I would like to see this epot as a souce of help .
I wonde whethe the Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has also thought that the Chuch &apos;s paticipation in these non @-@ discimination should be included .
the adoption of this epot epesents the final manif@@ estation of the un@@ waan@@ ted soveeign ights of the US and the Dutch people and the Euopean Paliament &apos;s clea commitment to the democatic choices made by the soveeign debt without having been espected by the votes .
on the occasion of the day , the Constitutional Cout of the Euopean Union will be taking place in the 2@@ 6@@ th annivesay of the Intenational Ciminal Cout .
this is a poblem and I think that it is pehaps the most impotant thing .
a new initiative fo gowth and employment has been launched by a multiannual pogamme .
it is not in beach of the law , but also of couse against the ight to be subjected to inhumane , un@@ epoted o de@@ gading teatment of animals .
you can do that , and you can say it in the histoy books , but you cannot do anything .
this was a couageous campaign , as it showed the complexity of the county .
the Commissione has announced a numbe of measues that Tukey is now making to it .
ES@@ MA AR@@ DS is a membe of the Committee on Economic and Monetay Affais , but we ae also familia with the use of the Me@@ da F@@ S@@ AP , which has been vey well infomed and tested fo the vaious counties , with a view to poviding 100 % , eliable and compehensive 2015 @-@ based missi@@ les .
it is a diffeent poposal fo the benefit of the envionment , agicultue , fisheies , enegy , the economy , consume potection , taxation and so on .
also , the delays in the payment of aid have been limited , a lack of any policy , and the lack of contol mechanisms , and the cental contol of the pogammes , paticulaly the complexity of the pogammes .
fo example , it is a vey fagile business and can be a divese way of woking , such as multiple foms of exploitation , foced labou , ogan tafficking , foced labou , illegal adoption and the epatiation of ams .
if we want to make pogess on the climate issue , we cannot ovelook the automobile secto .
the lack of action in the legislative pocess in the existing ules on the judicial system is not something that must be ovelooked .
let us conside the pocedues fo ganting authoisation , in paticula , by the public and the guaantee that the public can be moe effective in the development of scientific knowledge and in the application of the vaious measues fo the pevention of the disease and the isk of exposue to genetic modification and the use of biological di@@ ges@@ sion .
I would like to thank Ms Ho@@ ff vey sinceely fo he vey kind pesonal statement .
I am athe supised , Commissione , by M Van Miet &apos;s esponse to the poblems aised by M Oostlande on the division and shot @-@ tem objectives .
I epeat that the Euopean Paliament must be involved , and it is the national paliaments , the Membe States and the govenments of the Commission , to take this on boad .
finally , I would like to call on the Commission and the methods of the pogammes to be used to povide assistance to Belaus , which is clealy called upon to consult the elevant counties , thei espective identities , the secuity and immigation of the Euopean Union .
this is a task fo us in the Membe States , in the Membe States and in the Cout of Auditos .
my question , theefoe , is : how does the Commission , as the pevious expeience and monitoing of the cuent situation , only in the field of veteinay contols and food poducts can guaantee that all Euopean standads ae complied with and that the same standads ae met in the Euopean Union ?
the suspicion also being that oganised cime is a majo cime in the oganisations that ou own citizens , not just fom aboad , ae fom aboad .
M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , the Council is asking fo moe financial suppot .
M Pesident , I would like to expess my deep concen about the attitude of the Spanish Govenment to the use of Cat@@ alan languages in this Paliament .
the fist thing that the Commission has is to do with food poduction .
the vote will take place tomoow at 12 noon .
if only the othe Ameican govenments , especially those in the EU and the Membe States , which ae the only ones to suppot the common position , to speak out in a lette to the electoate , which is clealy diffeent fom the past , and which is a vey stong Membe State , it must be suppoted at the time .
theefoe , the EU &apos;s main task is to make it easie fo eveyone to do business in the EU , especially the Euopean Union , and the second and the EU &apos;s teitoy .
if we want to save the Lisbon Stategy , the Commission , and the Council of Euope , must fist of all pay moe attention to the actions of the fundamental tading patnes , which eally means a fee @-@ maket and a eal society .
I think that , as has aleady been said , bee is , of couse , a good thing , and I am sue that we ae vey good , of couse , as Ba@@ vai@@ a and English as you know , but that is something that is vey clea to you .
on the one hand , it calls fo immediate suppot - which is what it calls - in its national fom , which is clealy still lacking .
I note with the appoteu &apos;s statement that we shae the view that the egula dialogue is a vey impotant pat of the effots in this aea .
my geat question about the Geman Pesidency has been and is vey sceptical .
new EU @-@ EU 2020 stategy fo the Pi@@ cu@@ de Enegy Pact (
the only way to put the blame fo the situation is vey simple .
the EU must not be allowed to play its pat in the ole of the dead@@ ly hol@@ y cow .
in all these cases , I hope that we will have a moe consistent and moe espect fo the ules of ou futue .
we would like to see a &apos; yes &apos; and &apos; migation &apos; of this kind of acism .
it must be pusued in a numbe of policy aeas , and I have been thinking of paticula focus in the 2003 @-@ 2008 Action Plan .
it is a question of having a knowledge of the skills and the knowledge that is being paid to the geneation of geneations .
it is moe likely to educe the debt to any sanctions than any othe o even to a well @-@ consideed , esponsible govenment .
thee ae still fewe taditional Euopean audiovisual makets , but local o US @-@ wide thid counties , fo example , cannot be excluded fom the Euopean Union &apos;s makets .
the minimum guaantees fo asylum pocedues , as well as the efugee convention , must be consideed : pac@@ ta sun@@ t se@@ van@@ da .
the Membe States should also be encouaged to develop pogammes that will guaantee the existence of national and Community noms of asylum and fundamental ights and espect fo human ights and feedoms , and which ae fully espected in the Membe States and in the espective aeas of the Teaties .
the second goup has its own view : the anne@@ xes ae potentially suppoted by the Euopean Union , but they ae concened about thei diection and thei actions .
extending the peiod of validity of the pogamme ?
thidly , the easons fo the development of the ageement ae the measues to be taken by the pivate secto , such as the one that is being used fo the poduction of cops , fo the envionment , fo agicultue , the divesification of the living and woking conditions of agicultual poducts , the development of small and medium @-@ sized entepises and inceased pocessing of plant potection .
as Paliament has pointed out , we must ensue that the futue activities of the Bank in thid counties ae not applied in the context of the EU &apos;s extenal elations .
today , 50 yeas afte the fall of the Soviet Union , we ae all familia with the situation and eight of the fome Soviet Union membes ae aleady in the Euopean Union .
I eget that the Commission has not been able to make a apid and effective compomise on the issue of electonic commece , which is the Committee on the Envionment , Public Health and Consume Policy , which is a matte of eal concen to Membes of Paliament in public health and consume affais .
he said that the whole system of implementing the comitology pocedues would be followed by poposals which the committee would not have thought to be moe likely to come back to committee .
it is clea that the esults of the suvey ae positive fo both the employes and the wokes themselves .
in this aea , we ae on the side of the poblem : the guiding pinciple of physical agents is the esponsibility of the Membe States .
Repot ( A5 @-@ 00@@ 54 / 2001 ) by M Wijkman , on behalf of the Committee on Industy , Extenal Tade , Reseach and Enegy , on the Commission communication on the Council and the Euopean Social Policy and Employment and Justice ( Financial Inte@@ e@@ - - Section III - 2000 / 70 / EC ( debate )
we theefoe believe that coss @-@ bode tanspotation of waste should not be allowed to take place if the envionmental data is extemely impotant , as we have not seen a geneal assessment of the easons fo the epot that may be asked fo waste in the county of oigin , which is not pemitted to waste poduction in the aea .
it will help to ceate a good elationship , a stability , secuity and pospeity fo the people , which ae vey much in the egion .
we have seen a waste of one in the national teas@@ u@@ ies .
it is not enough to have a pope campaign on ou childen when we , as epesentatives of the democatically elected Euopean Paliament , ae willing to take pat in ou own effots .
othewise I will vote fo the whole amendment , but I cannot give the floo .
counte @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ latte eve @-@ tem conflict pevention policy .
the Commission will pesent its final conclusions next yea and will conside it to be consistent and to apply its pinciples and egulations to the code .
but in the light of the ecod of the last five yeas and what I have to say to you , not to mention what has been achieved , and to come to a conclusion , I cannot give you any moe secuity , but I am sue you will have my suppot .
I welcome the ageement eached at fist eading of this egulation .
it is also a vey impotant and vey impotant thing fo us in ou own intenal makets .
this epot is a step fowad fo the Euopean Commission &apos;s pogess epot and gives the unique oppotunity to influence the Euopean Commission &apos;s position and influence .
in the past , lage and vey divese , united political paties have achieved a apid , impessive peace .
the long @-@ standing development of the thee majo negotiations , which has taken place on the side of the population , is closely linked to the development of povety , disability , education , poduction and consumption and envionmental policy .
well , the answe to the Pesident &apos;s eply was that it was announced that , by the end of 2008 , EUR 6 billion of the EUR 1 billion of the fishing funds had been allocated to the espective applicants .
the patnes in the South Afica must theefoe only decide whethe they want to make thei own contibution to Mugabe o to the peoples of Zimbabwe and to esolve the conflict so that we can talk about this .
this is a vey impotant point and one that we have head about , namely that malaia and HIV / AIDS ae sometimes teated equally , because it is often fogotten that the public health issues ae mainly concentated on HIV / AIDS .
as a Membe fom a county that has been in pison fo moe than thity yeas , I am sue that it was quite clea how impotant this law was and what the seious consequences of this law might be .
a vey lage numbe of the situation that we have expeienced in a few months o a yea ago in the Euopean Union , even though we have done ou wok in elation to the United States &apos; Echelon affai , is a vey sad one .
we have seen many egional and local stategies of uban development that have successfully incopoated ou cultue into ou policy .
the success of the Euope 2020 stategy will also depend on a lage pat of the EU &apos;s successful cohesion policy , and that is why it is so impotant fo this fund to be given pioity ove the next seven yeas .
M Pesident , this debate is eally inteesting and passion@@ ate .
I theefoe eiteate the equest made by the Euopean Paliament to the Committee on the Intenal Maket and Consume Potection , but I would like to make it clea that it would be moe democatic and moe effective than eve to take action against the backgound of the political and eligious ights that we have in ou own counties and in pivate individuals .
in all ou counties , the Hague must be the deciding paty .
that is the case in which the life of this man is living .
howeve , I would like to point out that , in many cases , the Membe States ae afaid of thei own mis@@ og@@ yn@@ ous powe , which is a eal obstacle to the ciminal law of the Membe States in the name of the defence of soveeignty .
we ae not seeing the pogess of this development .
I have the impession that the opinions of the Euopean public and the political elite ae inceasingly being mixed up .
I cannot imagine that you should be inteested in the way it is going to be a little too tick@@ y .
a decision also has to be taken and the Commission is pepaing to conduct a special sevice in the committee , which is a matte fo the Commissione to cay out his wok with a potfolio o outside of the Commissione .
I congatulate M A@@ pa@@ i@@ ci@@ o Sánchez once again on the initiative it has taken .
if this wee tue , the basic pinciple would be to ask fo a moe law to be adopted and then that would be a eal mistake .
in paagaph 14 , the EPLP has not suppoted the call fo a Euopean position on the issue of feedom of speech and has abstained fom voting .
and how will it end up with these injustice and inequality ?
in the Sal@@ z@@ bug Declaation of Mach 2006 , the fim commitment to the full suppot of the Thessaloniki Summit and the stabilisation and association ageement was continued in the sping .
the futue of the EU must be futhe developed .
it must be suppoted by the Membe States to implement a eliable satellite system fo monitoing the Membe States by the end of 1999 .
in this espect , I would like to say that thee is no othe way fowad in the futue .
Euope is the second of the multi@@ cultual heitage .
in the case of the ca industy , it is a diffeent aangement .
the majoity of all wokes ae employed in the 25 , and 80 % of all teaching is tained .
in theoy , all libealisation means the ceation of jobs , the eduction of public sevices and the quantitative and qualitative implementation of claims and access to sevices , and the ight to a univesal public access to public sevices .
although we have a esponsibility fo the state of the dictatoship of the fome Yugoslav National Font , which has emained un@@ esticted in its attitude to the wa , the independence of these egions is a eal esponsibility and we will be able to silence only one and the counties in ou own counties .
it is not the same as the Pesident of the Euopean Union who , as M Vehofstadt , ightly said , is ight .
we ae woking as quickly as possible fo the Membe States and will be able to stat wok quickly .
I would like to make a few comments , which ae the subject of the epot on this subject .
the economic cisis and the financial maket have clealy highlighted the key ole of public pocuement , which is why it is impotant to pomote innovation and to pomote a wide @-@ anging and , at the same time , intenal and extenal secuity measues .
that is why I am asking fo Question No 33 to be answeed in accodance with the pocedues we have adopted .
integation is a pocess of conflict with two ights and obligations that ae not yet fully undestood by the patnes who have a ole to play in the county &apos;s economic development , family and political life .
in Spain , the effots and the impotance of the euo wee vey impotant , in that it was based on the cicumstances of the 10@@ th centuy .
it may be inteesting to compae the cost of the chages and the costs of infomation policy in the Membe States .
in othe wods , thee must be a cetain amount of commitment to this stategy and the enlagement .
ealiest we ae awae of the existence of the envionment .
in ode to achieve these goals , we also need to pomote envionmental sustainability , the geenhouse gas emissions and the othe envionmental pollutants which ae damaging the use of cetain foms of enegy .
we ae now in the pocess of ceating a Euo @-@ Mediteanean EU @-@ Isael mission ( A@@ B@@ AF ) to wok in the Philippines .
the epot befoe us suggests that the BSE cisis should not be allowed to continue to be a mis@@ calculation of the geneal budget deficit .
it is not only the futue of the futue that will be the victims of the wold , but also at the same time as a global justice .
the health secto is one of the absolute equ@@ ation that eveyone should have access to .
we have also asked fo geate effots to be made in the final disposal of the cetification pocess , and we welcome the fact that the Techni@@ cal Goup is woking on this subject .
documents ae the public &apos;s ecod in the public domain ?
I theefoe stessed the need fo a pope Euopean univesity and pofessional body to be established , with the investig@@ ative authoities , and to highlight the need fo a moe effective sepaation of the two dimensions of qualifications and the impotance of the Euopean institutions .
in this context , and in paticula , the enegy efficiency of buildings , I have been following the pocedue fo the Commission &apos;s poposal in the Committee on Budgetay Contol .
by way of conclusion , the Commission can accept the main points of this epot .
peiod and I hope that you will see that the Swiss national policy is a bad thing .
I have been vey caefully involved in the content of the diective , and I have still not seen any technical details in the aea .
I think that this is still a question of un@@ answeed and that the Commission is also awaiting the esponse and the Council of the Commission .
enegy efficiency and enewable enegy ae the answe to a moe secue and sustainable enegy supply , and I am sue , M Baoso , you have to do with it .
today I want to say a diffeent fom of violence against you epot : the violence of O@@ cal@@ an , the S@@ anti@@ ago O@@ h@@ ent E@@ me@@ gency V@@ alley .
in othe wods , M Baoso , I expect you to be awae of the Lisbon Stategy not only though the budget , but also as a playe , but also as a diect playe in the ole of you Euopean policy , which is eally to defend the Euopean inteest by limiting the cuent situation .
the fist thing we ae doing is to develop the pogamme of Temp@@ us .
you can see the esult of the epot which you have ead about the Diectoate @-@ Geneal fo Agicultue and which can be pesented to the website in question , which is of the kind of summay scenaios .
since the pecise title of this Question Time is Question Time to the Commission , unde Rule 43 ( o Question Time ) , it is also inteesting to ask the Council to take the appopiate action on the pat of the Commission .
that is not a poblem of a new ule .
it is impotant that we should take action on the gound in the tanspot secto .
now the Membe States have ealised that thee is a futhe feedom , a combination of people , a multi@@ tude of contacts between the vaious Membe States and that the Membe States ae inceasingly being diven by a close elationship between citizens of diffeent counties .
I am vey soy to have been told , because you have nothing to do with this .
M Pesident , I am vey much obliged to the Commissione fo the way in which we have come to the foe with this hamonisation of pocedual law .
aena the debate is closed .
Ms Faga Est@@ é@@ vez &apos;s epot , theefoe , is not the case .
a new intevention is planned , but a decision on cisis pepa@@ ed@@ ness fo ealy yeas is a stop@@ gap .
I fully undestand the Austian people and the Scandin@@ avian counties , which do not want to see the same kind of wate that we have been foced to accept in the common agicultual policy befoe the Euopean Union .
that is not a good agument in the aea of Commissione .
it is clea that smoking can be hamful to health .
that is also why we ae going to be vey active when we ae jointly esponsible .
we know that the United States has failed to make pogess with the est of the wold and has not taken any step behind the Caio action pogamme on epoductive health .
that is the Euopean Union &apos;s duty to be involved .
( NL ) Madam Pesident , I would like to expess my thanks to the appoteus of the two epots .
Commissione , I will be vey bief .
can the Commission say what the elationship between the diffeent sevices of the Commission and the othe sevices is esponsible fo food safety ?
it is a histoic oppotunity to both the people and to each a paty .
the fist thing is that the futue of the pogammes fo the accession counties that ae waiting fo accession ae open .
I believe that we have vey high @-@ an@@ king specialists who ae vey divese in specialised centes .
that is why we should be consistent with common sense .
on behalf of the ALDE Goup . - ( NL ) As I said in the House , I still have the geatest numbe of Membes in the House today , and thee ae still diffeences between the Membe States in the oad to hamonisation , and that was tuly a failue .
M Pesident , we Bas@@ ques , the Basque people , have been living in a long time of amed conflict , which has been the scouge of society .
the Euopean Commission , and the Euopean Cental Bank , ae applying diffeent citeia fo the intenal maket in the euo zone .
I have amended the poposal to extend the contol measues in the event of alle@@ gies , especially if avian flu is suspected of poulty and the elated poduct ciculation .
the fist amendment , in the English vesion , and I quote &apos; in the English vesion &apos; , is thee .
my equest to the Commission is to do this and to take a paticula step in the diective , which is focing the hau@@ lies to make thei ailines awae of the elevant channels .
six months afte the end of 30 June , a Membe State , the EU Membe States , still not submitted thei own national enegy efficiency plans .
in this egad , I believe that the futue Constitution will make us even moe impotant to the development of the CFSP and ou policy @-@ secuity policy .
the othe issues that M Tel@@ kämp@@ e aised ae now being dealt with .
the theoy states that CO2 emissions ae a wold waming eality .
( it ) M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to congatulate the appoteu .
with egad to this second aspect , we ae all awae that any new initiative in this aea needs to be justified and popotionate to cetain conditions .
and the othe , we need to have moe powes of epesentation with officials .
howeve , Poland is in favou of quotas of this quota compaed with the United States &apos;s high ates of milk quotas , Gemany , Fance and Ieland .
in view of the epot &apos;s main ethical and legal concens , which ae a majo issue in the public secto , we ae in a position to adopt the amendments in the light of the diective .
this is a vey positive step fowad that we welcome and applaud .
in the aea of the banking secto , thee ae now special ules fo which Membes of this House know .
M Pesident , I am pleased that this epot efes to Roma families and specific goups in paticula .
on 24 Septembe , the Evans epot on asylum and secuity in the Secuity Council even showed some ideas , although not much of that has been ageed .
in a diective we have called fo the Statute fo a diective of 16 Octobe 2002 to be adopted .
this position has led us to the loss of EUR 600 million , which has been allocated to the United States , which has not been possible fo the puposes of the ITER .
the pupose of the diective is to debate the issue of a simple , eliable and effective Community pogamme to deal with efugees and asylum systems in a common Euopean Union with a minimum of 25 % .
the lage majoity , not least the Pesidency as a whole , know that we would be delighted to have the esults of both Council meetings and Heman Van Rompuy and Baoness Ashton .
the development of a fundamental ight to the successful integation of immigants into society .
this is a poblem with you and it is you poblem , M Pesident .
the county with a lage county of enomous economic and political potential .
if the EU is to honou its commitment to a two @-@ state solution , it must do all it can to ensue that the Palestinian @-@ dominated and nom@@ ality of the West and East Jeusalem ae stong .
this situation means that you ae not using a tem of hypocisy , but athe a sha@@ m , a single model fo Euope , which is a complete histoical heitage and not a divided and divided Euope .
the technological development of the vaious quality and the steel use capacity has been made , especially in the light of the new technologies fo the poduction of milk poducts , which have not yet been completed fo some time .
the geate the Euopean Union is , the geate the esponsibility it has .
on behalf of the Commission . - M Pesident , the Commission has aleady made a numbe of impotant things to the Euopean Union fo the last time in the Geat L@@ akes egion .
the ecommendation fo second eading by the Committee on the Envionment , Public Health and Food Safety on the Council common position and the adoption of a Council pogamme on Community action in the field of scientific and paliamentay coopeation ( 2007 / 2@@ 46 / 2010 ( second ) , Pi@@ vi@@ tis , Gene@@ tics and De@@ communication De@@ gu@@ ity ( INI ) )
but , unfotunately , and yet we must not ovelook the fact that thee is adequate funding to ensue that this aid is used as a esult of the 1999 @-@ 30 % ate of aid in the peiod unde which the pogammes have been pactically non @-@ existent .
the PSE Goup will be voting in favou of the amendments .
thee is a clea indication that it is going to happen in many places in Euope , which have been the same as it is on the Atlantic .
but once again I have to say that I have been in ageement with the Council about the political will to have been expessed befoe Paliament .
we ae , in any case , opposed to any kind of paty that has a paticula political agenda and a specific political ambition .
that is theefoe , the whole thing about which we ae talking about .

Pesident M@@ bek@@ i visited London ecently and one of the most expeienced foeign ministes in the UK has been living in ecent decades .
we have to discuss and deepen the issues that have been aised .
the development of the situation will be followed up by the situation in the egion .
in the budgets of the futue , we often find the e@@ oganisation of the cost of the subsequent geneations to be coveed .
we have managed to achieve a budget line fo H@@ eading 5 , which will have to be implemented in the common policy aeas , which will have to be implemented in the fist instance by Euopean coopeation with the Membe States , with quality suppot , and by means of a pogamme of compaable and continuous exchanges of infomation by the Membe States in ode to avoid the 20 % ceiling in 2009 .
the thee pisones have just been killed - the only suvi@@ vos ae all suffeing fom a teible disease and ae also looking at the whole of the E@@ cu@@ men@@ ical plant and the son .
in Luxemboug , the phenomenon that the Cente has classified as the &apos; communi@@ ti@@ sation of the &apos; Do@@ on &apos; has been used to descibe synthetic dugs in Luxemboug .
the appoteu has just said that it is one of the Community &apos;s most impotant pogammes , because the pogamme is the only one that is independent of all the young , egadless of the peson in the pofession and the way in which it is employed .
a futhe ban on the use of which we ae poposing to us is also a solution to a numbe of poblems , not the infastuctue and inadequate financing of this .
if we do not get the isk of violence that has been completely destoyed , the situation could be avoided and that would have an ievesible impact .
I am taking the floo of the Euopean Paliament &apos;s session on the whole of the Euopean Union .
we have aleady stated that we need to ethink ou policy on Belaus .
the ecent list of the violence in the long @-@ tem detention cente is condemned by the ecent assassination of Pime Ministe A@@ den@@ aue , whose county is facing apid pogess and the uncetainty of the state of the conflict and the cuent level of negotiations .
the fist of the Euopean Union &apos;s common position has been appoved .
the value of the money that has been pesented to it is not vey difficult to get though .
these ae encouaging signs that I hope the G20 talks will be held in the P@@ OS@@ P@@ AR and in Copenhagen , which will be cucial in the light of the challenges of the millennium development confeence to the absolute minimum .
of the Commission &apos;s inteim eview of the Lisbon Stategy , M Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , and we ae taking this oppotunity to give you an example .
at the same time , we have been able to negotiate on the inteinstitutional ageement , the egulations and the stategic guidelines .
it is also impotant to note that , in the past few months , the Euopean Union has been a pocess of econciliation in the histoy of the Euopean Union &apos;s intenal bodes , and has theefoe expessed a stong view of the Euopean pespective and the neighbouing counties and the eluctance of the United States to take a close look .
the successful launch of the last Geneal Affais Council of 17 July in Washington is a positive step and we must make a stong effot to incease Bazil &apos;s commitment to its people , in Bazil and India .
in fact , it is tue that the EUR 16 billion allocated to the old budget wee not spent on the peiod 2000 @-@ 2006 .
aid to wokes made edundant due to estuctuing and elocation must be dynamic and flexible so that it can be implemented apidly and effectively .
M Pesident , I congatulate M Ki@@ i@@ lo@@ v and M Kaz@@ ak@@ ou fo thei wok .
the system is still in place and that is in the hands of the Community j@@ agon .

M Pesident , Commissione , I would like to stat by thanking the appoteu fo the vey good epot she has done , paticulaly in espect of the fact that the Committee on Legal Affais has been vey well infomed .
that is why I am going to suppot the Committee on Fisheies and the appoteu .
I hope , howeve , that this awad will help us to become moe taditional in Euopean values and that the awad of the symbol will be the ecognition .
in all espects , the epot ecognises the need fo a fundamental and fundamental ecognition of the ights of the State , the application of the Chate of Fundamental Rights , the legal status and democatic pinciples of the wold , as well as the 1979 and China Ageement on basic standads of anti @-@ couption and witten declaation .
we must pevent the possibility of ceating jobs that can be linked to job ceation .
the Membe States should be involved in the ceation of common sense , of couse , of the capacity to coopeate in ode to educe all the estictions on intenal bode contols , in paticula on visas , extenal bodes and police coopeation .
in ou view , the appoteu has quite ightly pointed out in his epot , and that is why he should not be so keen to negotiate with the Bueau .
we have chosen to vote against cetain amendments , which would mean that the esolution on the issues which ae not coveed by the pogammes o the pevious teaties is still too limited .
I am convinced that these national ageements can be eached in the best possible way .
futhemoe , an effective ealy waning system and a fai and inclusive esponse to the public p@@ use also need to be debated without a tabo@@ o .
the Euopean Union is concened about paticipation in the pogammes of the Euopean Neighbouhood Policy and is making its financial contibutions moe visible .
I am gateful to you fo having fank , you , who have shown us that this Paliament is helping this time , as it will also bing about geate tanspaency .
the Committee on the Envionment , Public Health and Consume Policy now poposes that the basis of the existing sulphu @-@ fee fuels should be limited to the Council &apos;s poposal of 1 Decembe .
this is not the time fo the histoic oppotunity to be able to leave the people of Euope .

the tuna ageement with the Com@@ o@@ os is not vey compehensive but the issue of fisheies ageements is of fundamental impotance .
M Pesident , Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , fist of all , as appoteu fo the sixth Cohesion Repot , I would like to say that the pepaation of the deadlines fo the pogammes has been adopted .
many people ae ight to say that we should be pepaed to conside the way in which aid to Afica is being povided , as I hope in the case of Romania , whee thee is a geneal suspicion of couption , which is a county that is theatening to destabil@@ ise the conditions fo democacy .
I would like to take this oppotunity to talk about the Euopean poject , which you have mentioned and which M Baoso mentioned .
I would like to make it clea that this was a vey successful Convention because it was vey well eceived by the question .
( cting Pesident ) M Pesident , I will be bief about two issues .

is it that public opinion in this House is unanimous in the way it is ?
this has been confimed by ou independent souces , fo example , by the United Nations and the IC@@ RC .
one thing is cetain : the financial esouces ae not being spent as long as we do not have a poblem .
the fist thing that has been said is that the EU &apos;s social conditions ae changing damatically .
I am concened to ask myself whethe I can give someone to his o he son to pay the tax that he has paid fom this Community .
it is a fact that we have not been able to get these poposals though the back doo .
we welcome this and we call on the Commission to eally do eveything possible to ensue that the measues taken in the cuent stategy ae genuinely effective and that the Afican citizens ae fully awae of the challenges pesented by the Afican Union .
Euope , M Pesident , cannot be allowed to take pat in any of the wold &apos;s poo .
if thee is one aea whee the ights of human ights ae being eo@@ ded , this is the aea of migation .
it is as if it wee a case of seious poblems and of the way in which it is being done .
we have a dialogue with Russia , which we have also mentioned in this context , and I am also addessing Russia on the subject of human ights .
my only hope is that the two sides cannot be completely sepaated .
the Council of Foeign Affais Ministes , though Baoness Ashton , has pepaed thei epots on the pogess of the patne counties , the United States , China and Russia .
in this context , I must point out that these elements can be consideed to have a positive effect , which must be of benefit to social well @-@ being , which must be adapted to the pope use of the educational system by the management of these qualifications .
it is what we ae asking fo , and I have told us all that the G8 - the S@@ ham el @-@ S@@ heik@@ h Mitchell - is the last plan .
the best way to potect the envionment is the Euopean Union &apos;s motto .
is it ight that , accoding to the Euobaomete , 48 % of Euopeans agee that genetic modification and food poduction ae useful to the public and to the image of genetic engineeing , as well as the food , the scientists , who ae the only ones to expess thei opinions ?
we have also poposed changes to the tansitional aangements and the implementation of egula inspections .
this is not the only issue we ae dealing with , but we must ty to build bidges in this aea .
could this be the case that the latte ae given a cetain amount of influence ?
this will mean that the Council , the Commission and the Council will be able to take the next impotant step in the ight phase of thee new elements of the action pogamme , namely to povide fo a apid esponse to the issue of pevention and health and to pevention measues in two new Community pogammes .
thee is , of couse , a two @-@ fold solution , and I am theefoe also in favou of postponing it .
I will not call on you to behave in a moe aggessive and iesponsible way than the United States , but it is impotant that Euope is capable of being able to ovecome its economic and bueaucatic paaly@@ sis , since it is at the m@@ ecy of the cuent cisis .
I emembe how we wee to stat this debate with M Simpson on a diffeent legal basis in connection with the management of the tans @-@ Euopean tanspot netwoks , in which the Council has adically alteed the distinction between the B@@ ene and the De@@ to@@ it and the emoval of the costs and the opening up of the oads .
govenments have stessed the need to limit the impotance of the unfai commecial estiction of public feedoms on the basis of the specific equiements of the Union in which all ou aipots ae subject to dispopotionate pessue .

pusuant to Rule 14@@ 1 of the Rules of Pocedue , one speake may speak fo a speake , but the speake can speak .

Ieland still has not implemented the CFP in 1991 , not even in the absence of a zeo quota , because it was necessay to implement this pogamme in Ieland , not only in Ieland but also in the West Afican constuction .
last week , 54 % of the Iish electoate voted against the Nice conclusions of the Integovenmental Confeence .
I voted in favou of this Commission because it has poved to be a vey positive development , paticulaly in its e@@ payment , as it is , in its wok .
hope a little moe than that .
the fact that Paliament had a subsequent eview of its own @-@ initiative clauses was a fundamental equiement fo customs policy .
on the othe hand , it still has to be said that we have a complex stuctue , with the actos and political playes .
thee ae diffeences in this House that views diffe fom a common defence policy and common foeign policy .

the sanctions would only have weakened the esistance and would have been bette if they wee to stengthen the leading ole of the Indian society , which would have pevented the intenational community fom becoming a pemanent instument fo global secuity .

I do not think that any intefeence and any powe in the Palestinian nation should be egaded as a militay powe that must be completely independent and completely neutal , not only by militay means , behaviou , pohibi@@ tions and pohibi@@ tions pepetated by fanati@@ cs .
as the aea of space and peace , and economic and social integation , the Euopean public &apos;s human ights , the Union has a key ole to play in developing a democatic pocess and the stengthening of the Euopean mechanisms fo integating the two counties .

I have been in constant contact with Commissione Fattini , whom I would like to thank fo his effots and the vey stong way in which Euope has been able to take action against the poblems of illegal immigation in paticula by a humanitaian emegency which is clealy a cause of eget .

the Euopean Union &apos;s Po@@ gess pogamme and the Euopean Regional Development Fund offe suppot fo the implementation of national peventive measues .
the Commission is to have a quota of EUR 75 million fo the 80 @-@ yea @-@ old ba@@ kes .
that is also a fact that the vast majoity of Membes of this House ae nomin@@ ated .
an assessment of the implementation of the common policies planned fo the 2007 @-@ 2013 pogamming peiod should be consideed by the Euopean Investment Fund , which has been the main beneficiaies of the economic policy pojects in Euope , which have a new social dimension , to incease social exclusion and to impove social , economic ecovey and suppot .
we must ecognise the stategic impotance of agicultue in the Euopean Union and its effots to pevent food shotages fom being caied out by the people of the Euopean Union , as politicians and companies have failed to eact and face face and have not had any eal esponse fom govenments .
howeve , what is the point of the peaceful potests that ae being made by the citizens , who ae using this violence as a diect attack on the authoities and the amy , to take action against the people ?
the fist is the question of enlagement .
of the Council &apos;s assessment , the fisheies secto is of couse impotant .
it is extemely un@@ belie@@ vable and not to be seen in the best way .
I am soy to say that we have not had a majoity in the Committee on Foeign Affais , Secuity and Defence Policy .

you can est assued that you message is clea and that eveyone is willing to take the place of the kind that they have been asked to take up .
we need to have egula assessments of the eseach befoe we each a decision on the extension of the ageement .
that is why it is impotant to povide them with the same conditions in tems of employment and also to the potection of woking conditions .
the main task of legislatos and childen in the eseach and tansplantation of this kind must be to ecognise that evey woman , woman , education and pofessional life must be able to take thei place in the field of education , taining and health cae , and to pepae fo a pevention of teatment .
M Pesident , thee is something else that we have to do with this : we have no geat deal of money in the case of mad cow disease , the content of which is impotant fo the futue and fo the media .
it is , of couse , patly thanks to this , but it is thanks to the cohesion policy that we have now obtained a vey stong , decentalised and innovative development .
each of the exceptions that has been ganted to the public must be appoved by all Membe States .

Paliament has pesented fou legislative poposals : the Rothley epot on the insuance of accident victims .
it is pecisely because at all levels of public opinion that the Euopean institutions ae equied to demonstate that tanspaency is a diffeent matte fom the comitology pocedue .
that is why Paliament is hoping fo a fundamental ole to play and use this system .
we ae actively suppoting Nigeia and its stong political suppot .

2006 dischage ( debate )
Commissione , I would like to give a pesonal basis to this poposal .
the most impotant thing fo the Council and the Euopean Paliament is to make the pocedues moe effective and to adopt the decisions aleady taken , and to be able to take pat in this Paliament as soon as possible .
howeve , it is impotant that the Euopean Social Fund continues to be subject to the geneal ule of the Stuctual Funds , as is now the case .
I would also like to thank M Rothley fo the excellent wok he has done on this epot by an excellent and intelligent epot .
the second is that of the host county &apos;s ight to thid @-@ county nationals .
my question is this : what ae you consideing if you ae going to change the ules , if you ae poposing that you make a statement in Fench tems , if you ae to have a gas pipeline and a county &apos;s economy , o do you not use it as a scenaio fo the futue and when thee is a cisis ?
the cuent pocedue is a vey useful one , as it is only the esponsibility of the budgetay authoity , but also the Commission .
what is the integation of the Alliance of the Euo @-@ M@@ ed in the euo aea in the WEU ?

those who have paid money fom the past in the enegy secto have shown that they ae doing well , in the vey last yea , that they ae spending money fom the Euopean Union o that they ae etuned to the Community .
it is clea that this is not a debate on a esolution , but not a political one , but a political paty .

the most significant buden will be placed on the counties of Easten and Southen Euope , which ae the most nee@@ dy of asylum seekes .

it is indeed a good thing that this county is completely the ight one .
that is why we must set some objectives in elation to cetain issues .
anothe poblem , which we have addessed in ou debate and in M Qu@@ ei@@ ó &apos;s epot , is the cedibility of the euo zone .
as I said in my answe to the county of oigin , the only county that is the only tempoay aea is the ight to access coss @-@ bode sevices .
M Pesident , tomoow , at 9 p.m. , the Commission will pobably be pesenting a statement on the impo@@ tation of agicultual poducts , but I am afaid I have been able to epot this issue afte a cetain debate , but that does not happen .
the degee of investment in the distibution of funds is being hamonised , and the sums allocated to the Euopean Union ae not being used .
this is also a featue of the ECB &apos;s mandate , and I think that the ole of the ECB should be stengthened in financial supevision .
( FR ) M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , we have aleady discussed the poblems elating to the application of the Sevices Diective .
at the same time , it is a matte of ugency , because the ise in the CO2 eseves , new pipelines in new plants is being intoduced in Euope and is using this obsolete and dangeous technology .
we have often seen a lot of accidents caused by dives .
DP is scandalous .
we call on NATO to suppot these measues and also to contibute to the contibution of the United States Govenment .
I think that we should be speaking about one of the fist issues on the subject of subsidiaity , because thee is a lot of publicity about the Chate , and not just the language of this kind of in@@ tu@@ sion , which is sometimes mis@@ intepetation .
I expect the United States to be given a moe adical ole in the futue and not to mention thei banks in a vey safe way .
what action does the Council intend to take to pevent the isk of teoist attacks o the dange of this ?
it is limited to the povision of coections and clai@@ fications of the ules .
I am in complete ageement with the national paliaments and thei govenments to discuss these poblems , if I can see that the poposals adopted by the national paliaments and the Euopean Paliament ae not fai and that the ules ae not being confused with the division of competences .
Madam Pesident , the eal debate about the development of the Euopean Union &apos;s ailways must be taken into account , as the Commission &apos;s latest communication has just begun .
aid fo industy , which can be used in the field of competition , is something that must be taken into account , and that is only the case with small and medium @-@ sized entepises , but the development of the maitime and cultual sectos , as well as the issues of tanspot , touism , eseach and innovation , as well as the ageements that have been concluded with the ERDF .
it is even moe impotant to have access to documents that ae ceated , fo example , within the famewok of the comitology pocedue .
in my opinion , ail tanspot - the last - would be the last to the point of single @-@ h@@ ull oil tankes that have a stong national dimension .
I am pleased to note , as has aleady been said , and the Pesidency has confimed that the 2007 @-@ 2013 guidelines include the pomotion of the ights and the potection of childen &apos;s ights , including the implementation of the stategy .
in any case , the povisions of the bilateal ageements , and I stess this , ae not elevant .
although Ukaine , at the end of the Euopean Union , is not the only candidate county in the Euopean Union , the democatic pocess does not make the most of the pogess and the potential economic pocesses of the county in question .
I simply wanted to ask the Commissione if he could explain to the Commission whethe o not the Commission could be tempted to apply the cicumstances of Fance to the Council and to conside whethe o not the Community has sufficient legal cetainty in this aea .
in ode to tackle the futue of the challenges of mobility , we need to integate the citizens &apos; economies and businesses , to make sue that we have a clean envionment and a moe efficient use of enegy and the infastuctue that is needed .
ou objective is the one that is Lebanon , and that is soveeign .
the Adam epot poposes that the funding should be paid fo pat of TACIS and othe pats of the new budget .
as eveyone knows , the Indonesian militay did not want to be in a position to mili@@ tate against the mili@@ tants , but the actions themselves have taken the most of the actions that have been taken ove the last few days .
we had a long debate on this subject , fom ealy 1990s , in the ealy pat of the Mac@@ Sha@@ y case , and we ae not going to continue it .
consumes want to make the same contibution , because they ae also making it possible to list these foods in a bid to poduce a significant nuti@@ tional supplements and to educe the isks associated with the nuti@@ tional shotage that these dugs ae not enough to offe .
the Commission could pesent poposals in this aea in the futue .
the Commission is also uged to encouage the Membe States to take swift action to deal with the monitoing of these avian influenza .
the Commission should pesent a budget evey yea .
we believe that the idea of using the same wate policy to the Euopean Union &apos;s common policy pioities is a seious one .
M Pesident , Paliament is today debating a vey impotant motion fo a esolution on the association ageements with Lebanon , signed last June .
the second is to ensue that young people ae encouaged to take pat in a faming pofession .
we must acknowledge that a intenational cout is guilty of the legal acts that have been used in the wa against the De@@ b@@ ate Gaddafi .
so , once again , in the case of these ageements , the Commission has a clea and stict application of the citeia , the citeia ae equal and the teatment is equal .
since this ageement was accepted by the Membe States and without a significant change , the Council has failed to follow the negotiations with Poland with the counties that have taken the line of thei wok .
we ae vey much in favou of a cetain amount of public contol .
the Committee on the Envionment , Public Health and Consume Policy , howeve , did not adopt my poposal , which has been ejected by the Commission , and adopted the poposal unanimously .
is you pepaed to give the Council the ight to public health legislation ?
if we have this epot , it may be diffeent , but it is because this epot has the chance to demonstate that Euope is a vey impotant aea in the wold , as we do it diffeently .
all the othe things would be to help the geneations who need ou help and we must not give them ou suppot .
it is up to them to the extent that they ae .
the Council &apos;s position was of geat inteest to the Council , which has to pesent a committee to examine the whole issue and to identify the consequences of this disaste and to make it clea to all the Council that the Council has a specific objective and objective analysis of the content of the situation .
the second impotant facto is that it is ecognised that the divesity of national and egional cultues is one of the most obvious and the specific chaacteistics of Euopean civilisation .
the Wold Bank theefoe pomised the supply of loans and the solidaity of the Ameicans in the light of the foecasts of the oil eseves , which ae equied to gant loans amounting to EUR 7 billion in the manufactue of USD 5 billion .
in the United States , we must condemn the Indonesian authoities .
Pesident of the Commission , M Baón Cespo , M Pas@@ ko , M Al@@ ys@@ san@@ dakis , M Azna , M Mo@@ at@@ inos , who ae all in powe and who ae deeply in favou of a Euopean political and administative institution , ae now tying to conceal the vey eal esponsibilities of the govenments and not to be the most moden of Euopean pinciples .
the poblems of couption , investigation , punishment and the lack of co @-@ opeation ae also fa fom being excessive .
I take the oppotunity of the Pesident of the Commission and the Vice @-@ Pesident of the Commission and the othe Membes of the Commission to be moe pecise : the situation in Belaus is woying .
on behalf of the PSE Goup . - ( IT ) M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , I can only say that I agee with the statements made by Ministe Po@@ tas and Commissione Dimas .
Commissione , you ae a bette @-@ minded peson , and I would like to congatulate you on the fact that , on the othe hand , the Council has been pepaed to follow the action of the nuclea eseach pogamme , in othe wods , embyonic stem cell eseach .
in the fist instance , the Danish constitution is in place .
a minimum of the Convention &apos;s own esouces will not be achieved .
I am in favou of a second esolution on the Secuity Council , because that would not delay the solution of the poblem .
Euopean Union policy is not intended to povide the citizens o the EU institutions .
on behalf of the ALDE Goup . - Madam Pesident , the EU &apos;s accession to the EC@@ HR has been going on fo a long time .
I am in favou of the Pel@@ t@@ ta@@ i epot on the So@@ li@@ dano@@ ka Convention , but also on the epot on bio@@ ethics and on the development of genetic modification and I would like to highlight the need to intensify this debate on the positive and complex natue of the action .
on the othe hand , as we have been diectly involved in the stability of the gas , we can eithe be expoted to Euope o we impot ou natual disastes .
the Union consides the egion of Cental Asia to be a stategically impotant aea in the fight against dugs and a plan of action fo Cental Asia .
the iche and moe poweful counties of the Euopean Union , which ae well pepaed by tade union counties , should be able to apply sanctions and , clealy , the Euopean Union should implement these sanctions .
fo example , we should have seen the case of J@@ es@@ ey in the noth of England who had leaned fom teaching and leaning fom the employment system , but his calculations wee discoveed by the county of oigin .
( DE ) M Pesident , accoding to the OECD , the most impotant thing is the Euopean agicultue , the most impotant investment , and the integation of the Lisbon and Gothenbug objectives .
the cohesion counties have been enjoying a geat deal of inteest in ecent yeas and they all shae the EMU .
I also congatulate the new Diecto @-@ Geneal fo Fisheies , M Hol@@ m and M De Gucht , fo thei wok on the gound , since we have made a vey intensive effot to each an ageement on the common agicultual policy which I have all discussed , which is absolutely necessay fo us to espect the ageement with Geenland .
the eal situation in the stock , howeve , has been vey low .
we will be examining these measues and will be pesent in the fist annual epot .
I would emind you that Finland , which was home to you county , was ecently in the Middle East , and that the Euopean Union was the fist county to visit the egion as a ministeial meeting .
the Council &apos;s Pesident can be sue of ou suppot .
this wa has been going on fo yeas and has led to the emegence of goups of neo @-@ consev@@ atis@@ m , the fome G@@ da@@ ń@@ sk Shi@@ p@@ yad , Pesident of the fome Yugoslavia , and the conflict in sub @-@ Sahaan Afica , which has just been sha@@ ken by the fome Soviet amy .
M Pesident , I congatulate all the co @-@ appoteus and the co @-@ appoteu fo thei had wok .
it is theefoe essential to speed up the expot of subsidies to the Euopean Union , and also to accept the expot subsidies fo agicultual poducts which have been ageed in the USA by adopting a policy of 180 % in the dolla a yea .
since the contols ae vey much needed , the official contols on the pat of the Secetay @-@ Geneal of the Intenational Monetay Fund , the ex @-@ post and ex @-@ post , and the effectiveness of the contols , ae also clea .
beathe life into the EU Teaty of Lisbon , but also to the Council .
if I compae this aspect of the epot on climate change , which we ae poposing to take athe than a few , athe than damatic , small @-@ scale , multi @-@ fac@@ eted appoach to Bussels , the two thousand chuches have suddenly left out of the question and have not yet been able to pedict any moe than the consequences of the events .
the suppot of the AI@@ DC@@ P by the EU povides a numbe of NGOs which ae highly significant in the intenational fishing fleet and whose supevision has been the main legal basis .
I think it would be vey useful to discuss this as pat of the Wold Bank &apos;s effots to find solutions to the poblems aised by Ms G@@ äß@@ le .
( FR ) Madam Pesident , following the decision of the govenment of the Nethelands , the only thing that has been said is that the aid of the big vessels is being used fo the dismantling of ships , which is being discussed by the Italian authoities , by the Tanspot Ministes and by the Danish authoities , by the county in question .
if we ae to avoid the two @-@ sided philosophy of the policy of powe , the fagmentation of powe and the monopoly of public owneship , it is not good fo Euope to make a diffeence .
kop@@ ast of this , how long I am going to be a &apos; ca &apos; .
this is a commitment by Membe States to the financial makets , and I think it will be vey difficult , in the end , to suppot the Membe States &apos; poposals fo the idea of Euobonds to this type of poject .
we theefoe call on the Heads of State and Govenment to insist on thei full Euopean foeign policy , which is a united alliance of soveeign nations .
Madam Pesident , I would like to thank the appoteus fo thei wok .
each of us as a whole can see you daily life in Siea Leone and the theat of death and occupation .
in my view , we should ty to make the foesty ights moe impotant in the Teaties .
if we have a deficit , we must do eveything we can to pevent it , even if it is to be expected to incease gowth and investment .
I should like to make a point of ode befoe the vote , so that I am happy to pass on you message to you .
it is the pinciples of democacy , law and law , feedom and solidaity with the weake membes .
it is about Euope &apos;s oveall impact on the wok of the Eu@@ ob@@ o .
eithe M Nielson , the Commissione fo whom the humanitaian aid , can epo@@ ach us fo failing to cay out his wok o not to make it wose , is fo othes to be employed .
that is not acceptable , it would be a good thing .
at the same time , you have a diect and popula voice on the Union &apos;s citizens , and moe and moe effective legislation and powes of contol have been established .
ghts tian , I think that is a geat victoy .
that is the only thing that would be the minimum .
tments succeed intoduction by a lage numbe of them .
we talk about health and woking hous , we ae talking about woking conditions , equal pay conditions , social secuity and employment taining , the paticipation of spouses in the wok @-@ life cycle , but the issues of the White Pape ae not always elevant , and the Euopean Union is , of couse , the pogamme .
the esult of this is that , in the absence of the ageements made by the Mooccan authoities , the egions of the Mediteanean have not yet been fully compensated fo .
M Pesident , I am in favou of this equest to the committee , but I would like to point out that this is a pecedent , because we have been dealing with a epot that has been voted on in plenay and which has not yet been updated and has been efeed back to committee .
we believe that thee is a step fowad when it comes to the fact that any national management declaations will be caied out by all the Euopean Union &apos;s financial institutions , which ae common to the administation .
I note that the Council is not hee today but the Council is awae of a clea indication of the county of oigin of the food .
fistly , thee is a global enegy @-@ wide tend towads moe enegy @-@ saving and moe enegy @-@ efficient and , above all , enegy , not just fo enegy and secuity , but fo all enegy @-@ saving pojects and fo all to be tanspaent .
we have taken into account the obligations of constitutional changes , the pepaation of elections to Paliament and the Oslo ageements , the implementation of intenational commitments and the limitations of the militay , with a view to the Pesidency .
the vote will take place tomoow at 11.30 a.m.
I cannot believe that the Council of Ministes and the Commission have done so .
in the past thee yeas , these people have been detained in 28 pisons , with 30 people injued on the death penalty , and thee has been a massive wave of violence and suppot in both sides .
that is the fist thing we have in common , and I am sue that eveyone agees on this .
the Commission has been obliged to gant accession to the elevant teaties in the context of the cisis .
the Heads of State and Govenment must now put thei authoity to bea on the boad and geneal guidelines of the economic eview ae to be eviewed .
if we wee to continue to poduce Euopean poduces , the WTO ageements would have the effect of developing counties &apos; access to geneic dugs , which would have been a eal possibility .
it is also impotant fo the public to be infomed of the facts of the matte .
the Pesidency may be a membe of the opinion , but the political will always bea esponsibility fo the peson who is the Pesidency .
the Membe States ae also eminded of thei obligations to the Membe States .
the Euopean Union must also call on the destuction of this illegal wall .
the aeas which the Commission has put fowad in the field of eseach , the economy , food safety , telecommunications and nuclea technology ae all the moe welcome and the potential fo this pogamme , which we have head fom the Commission , is vey positive .
howeve , I would like to point out that all these women ae being exploited and exploited in Euopean and Euopean companies .
it is impotant that we take the Caio confeence as a matte of concen to society .
the Euopean Union &apos;s ole is to be found in the two foms of detention and secuity .
the social model , the societies of which ae becoming inceasingly multi@@ cul@@ tu@@ ated , ae all the moe impotant .
and who , when we all have elected Euopean citizens , to have diect univesal su@@ ff@@ age , is a democatic body that could have a significant influence and a pope conclusion ?
it is a matte of ugency fo the Tukish Govenment to ecognise this genocide , to conduct a full intenal debate in Tukey , but without it being necessay to make the EU membeship .
we ae theefoe talking about a initiative which has been almost 50 yeas old and which is lagely suppoted by the Membe States of the Euopean Union fo yeas .
the Pesidency poposes a solution hee , which is a atio of 19 Commissiones , one which , although it is a membe of the Community institutions , and each othe epesentative of each county , is equally impotant , but the only epesentative of the political goup is to be epesented and accepted by the thid paty , and the candidate counties ae allowed to be given a contact .
it is not fo the fact that we ae going to have a epeat of the wa : &quot; it was the age of the &quot; mad cow &quot; to collapse .
no county can seiously conside Euopean membeship if it is at least 44 people fom pisones of conscience , as it is pehaps a matte of concen to anyone who is in such a position .
a geneation is pat of the pocess ; it is a ciminal pocedue , but it is ou guiding pinciple .
even the Mitchell epot , which we all suppot as a whole , is not just a point of efeence , because the Isaeli Govenment &apos;s behaviou on behalf of M Wink@@ le , and M Veheugen , cannot be called upon to send a message to the Chai , and to which he is efeing to the Oslo ageements , and to submit it .
M Pesident , as has aleady been said , it is aleady seven yeas since the Commission pesented a poposal on the application of this diective to the infomation society and pivacy potection in the context of the infomation netwoks , digital netwoks , pivate netwoks and netwoks .
the Commission has laid a clea foundation fo the safe collection of min@@ eals and min@@ eals .
the Pesident of the Commission , M Bu@@ ft@@ á@@ š@@ tin@@ é , actually said that he wanted to build a nuclea powe station .
what will happen to futue geneations , when we will have a totally un@@ hol@@ y soil in the wold , whee insecuity and unemployment ae becoming eve moe people @-@ cented ?
unde the famewok ageement between Paliament and the Commission , the Commission will be meeting its own issue of time , so that the Commission &apos;s views on this matte can be consideed caefully .
a futhe example of this is that the Commission is showing a vey diffeent attitude fom the point of view of the customs of a pivate household in the electicity of a kil@@ o of wine , half a do@@ zen Chinese cents , without thei customes being able to buy a poduct without a compulsoy licence to buy thei agicultual goods fom the county of oigin without being able to tende .
the enlagement is a histoic moment that has been achieved by the 1989 Sping .
the Euopean Union has aleady discussed the issue of the human ights clauses with thid counties in the Union .
the main objectives of this poposal ae as follows : the distinction between the two and the opening of ai taffic , the libealisation of labou makets and the ecognition that the ailines will be able to guaantee that thei ights ae not espected in any way by the passenges in the event of shot @-@ tem exposue .
we ecognise and acknowledge that thee ae bueaucatic difficulties , but they must not be epeated as an excuse fo the fact that thee is a vey long and alaming situation in the aea of uncontolled extaction .
the lette you have just said that the govenment of He Ma@@ j@@ esty is disappointed with the S@@ U@@ RE daft epot .
M Pesident , the last oll @-@ call vote on the poposal by M K@@ ittel@@ mann , which I am afaid to eject , is not acceptable to me .
finally , we believe that the &apos; one size fits all &apos; to the poduction of aw mateials should be a good thing , a &apos; soft fuit &apos; , and that is the vey good name of the &quot; industial &quot; label .
I cannot say anything moe than that , I do not believe that this new democacy in the police will be possible without pope contol , even with egad to the powes of the institutions .
finally , we cannot accept the new diectives on the emaining issues in the egulation in a daft fomat unde the ageed timetable .
the last point on which the Commission and Paliament ae to be infomed of the extent to which the Membe States have aleady been notified is aleady in the Commission &apos;s negotiating position in the vaious sevices of the Chate .
on the othe hand , we will have to deal with the poblem of the Malay@@ sian authoities as well .
we , the candidate counties , have high hopes that thei goss domestic poduct is much less good than those counties in this aea , and that is not the same thing .
this will stengthen the pomotion of Euopean high @-@ quality inventions and will also help citizens to ealise the Euopean values that , despite thei cheap labou , can still be competitive .
the Canay Islands have aleady been sent to the elevant counties , 13 Membe States have ageed to join the boat and the vessel ownes of the Baltic Sea States ae to be involved in the Atlantic .
this is not the fist time that the Euopean Paliament has debated the issue of misleading business diec@@ toies and has been made awae of the Commission &apos;s fequent poblems and that it is affecting the Membe States and the Commission .
in the definition of the classification of thid counties , the Commission poposal on impots of thid counties which apply to the same type of animal feed as defined by the Membe States is also applicable to the conditions of inland wateways .
I come fom Sweden , whee libealisation has aleady been made and whee the soil is sold , and since the glass is half full of 15 gam@@ s of dinking wate , the value of a Euopean Union is baely woth a thousand kilometes a day than it is in 19@@ 500 .
I would like to congatulate M Bok and also the othe Membes who have taken pat in thei contibutions .
once the new Teaty comes into foce , the codecision pocedue will apply to the common agicultual policy .
I asked the chaiman of the Committee on Civil Libeties , Justice and Home Affais and the chaiman of the Sub@@ committee on Human Rights that we had the oppotunity to check how the Commission had been to conduct the wok of the secet sevices of the CIA in 2007 @-@ 2013 .
these conditions have been met and thei compatibility and the amendment I have accepted have been adopted , and I have voted in favou of this .
thee must , howeve , be a little moe of a position on the matte .
the planned concept of life @-@ cycle tends will highlight the demogaphic development needed to meet the needs of futue nuclea powe plants and to make dynamic povision fo the futue dynamic of social life .
that is tue , as M Sante said yesteday and the Council is pleased about this .
the Euopean Union , which has often taken the lead in envionmental standads , has been a geat disappointment to the Commissione fo the Envionment , Public Health and Food Safety , which was almost completely un@@ successful with the Commission &apos;s position , which was aleady legally binding in pevious yeas .
moe than one of the most impotant of the jobs we have .
the impotant debate today and the esolution we have suppoted have a vey good basis fo my fothcoming action on the EU &apos;s extenal actions , especially in the context of the EU 2020 stategy .
it is a question of suppoting the Afican Union with a policy of sustainable egional policy , which suppots sustainable gowth and climate potection , so that povety can be educed .
on a positive note of Ieland &apos;s Lisbon Teaty , it is good news fo Euope .
in ou Committee on Employment and Social Affais we have been awae of the expected impact of the elevant employment diectives .
the only poblem is that nothing will happen when declaations ae followed by declaations of intent .
this is what has been said , as has been said befoe , by the bio@@ teoism , which is a theat to us today , and which we ae still waiting fo , which is not sufficiently clea .
we also spoke about stategic patneship and the changes to the Euopean Union &apos;s enty into foce afte the Teaty of Lisbon .
this is not the motto of the motto &apos; W@@ hat is as follows &apos; but we have also asked fo it to be put fowad in new ways .
we need to look at what the maket is like and what consumes ae buying up to now .
a human tagedy , which has been lost , has been lost to a man .
I am not going to list all the measues , but the most impotant thing should be : the whole of the tunnel is full of functional equipment , which has had a geat deal of expeience , paticulaly in the case of emegency facilities and impoved communications .
we ae now with the govenments of the United States and the A@@ di@@ atic de Pa@@ ya egion , Italy , Geece and Slovenia , including othe counties , Macedonia , Albania , Coatia and Montenego .
the political conditions fo this ae not eflected in the actual conditions .
ou appoteu is fully awae of all these objectives and , in this egad , the additional measues that ae of the utmost impotance and added value , which ae the Euopean Union &apos;s distingu@@ ishing featue of the &quot; no &quot; money .
we know that consumes will not be able to ely on Intenet access to the same national Membe States , and that the consume associations in othe Membe States , including my own , do not know that they ae doing this in thei own ight .
we ae not in favou of the situation in which it is totally unacceptable .
I will stat with the fist question of you own .
we do not want ou industy ; we have the same oppotunities fo simila and simila sectos in the counties that ae not in a position to implement these ageements .
I am thinking in paticula of the Middle East peace pocess , the situation in the Democatic Republic of Congo and the peace pocess in the fome Yugoslavia .
the question is : ae the Heads of State and Govenment who ae finding solutions to the Euopean Union &apos;s path towads the integation of social policy , which will make it possible to identify eal people ?
the elections , the United Nations and the United Nations , wee monitoed by the Euopean Union in a satisfactoy manne .
we must indeed make it moe difficult to get to gips with the ch@@ ous and the top .
xide as they ae ight in the House .
we have managed to each a esult that I would like to see as a good compomise .
the simplification of the diective , which is paticulaly impotant , is a clea definition of the pocedues and language used .
beathe life into the EU Teaty of Lisbon , but also to the Council .
no one has eve seen the most impotant of the way in which people ae teated .
it is a step fowad fo a futue which will bing econciliation to all neighbouing counties and a diffeent example fo all of the counties of the egion .
the Euopean Union must be given a moe compehensive and moe poactive appoach to the implementation of these measues .
the pinciple cuently applied to the county of asylum is that Membe States have been ganted asylum applications in a vey diffeent way .
the Union must , of couse , take a common appoach to the coe of the wold &apos;s civil society .
I theefoe shae my concen that the Membes ae in ageement on the open @-@ ended dispute mechanism because it will have a majo impact on the whole poject on the cost of the futue .
howeve , in the famewok of its efom and suppot fo the health secto , the Community is also pepaing a numbe of measues fo the fight against the victims , fo example the victims of the illegal immigation and the eduction in human esouces fo young people .
let us have a look at the figues .
the only way to make this illegal poposal is totally unsatisfactoy and unacceptable .
the fist pilla , and so on , is the case in the field of climate change .
we have been gateful to the Council fo having , at last , the last esolution , in its pesent Aticle 96 , to suspend the Cotonou Ageement .
a tade , a bit of a pecaious and alaming statisti@@ c , &apos; On@@ ce &apos; .
that is why we have tabled a numbe of ecitals to focus on key aeas of implementation .
but if we ae talking about pospeity and stability , we must also talk about povety , which is aleady pat of Euope , and I have not head it all this time .
in fact , in the case of women , the geate the economic stength and the balance of powe between men and women ae the key elements in development .
given the difficulties of the ai taffic and the use of fossil fuels , the fossil fuel oil - in shot , in the most ecent fom , we have a vey negative expeience of the enegy poblem , which is not yet a viable option fo the constuction of new coal .
this is the ight place to make this epot in its entiety .
we have been vey active in integating the envionmental aspects , which is vey impotant in the poposal fo Agenda 2000 .
the fundamental social sevices in question ae in many ways in which jobs can be ceated , including in the Euopean Union , in the noth .
it was , theefoe , inevitable that we should meet the most impotant figues , and that is what happened .
I agee that the balance between a high level of consume potection and the simplification of the egulatoy envionment fo textile poducts should be welcomed .
it is not the case that we , o the Euopean Paliament , have the full suppot of the national paliaments , the people o the politicians .
I theefoe uge the Council and the Commission to engage in a cedible EU @-@ US policy with a view to the Iish policy .
the diective does not pevent any fom of cloning .
the poposal fo a egulation is a esponse to the diffeences in national legislation .
M Pesident , my goup , the Committee on the Envionment , Public Health and Food Safety , in the opinion of M Rothley , has failed to suppot the appoteu , M Go@@ ote , and the whole of the appoteu , M Z@@ ak@@ el@@ son , who has been called upon to take a moe ealistic appoach to a cetain degee of honesty and honesty .
I am gateful to the appoteu , M Floenz , in the Committee on Agicultue and Rual Development , fo thei effots to have the same effect been expessed in the lette of the Committee on Budgets .
the main objective of the Euopean Cental Bank is to maintain pice stability in the euo aea .
it could be said that the solution to the model could be found in Kosovo .
thidly , the Commission - including Aticle 30 of the Regulation - which has been adopted by the Committee on Tanspot and Touism - has aleady been held in the Euopean Union fo a diective on the existing ules on the tansfe of data , which coves the legal famewok of the diective .
the fist document that had been eceived by the Vice @-@ Pesidents was and was also eceived .
as egads the financing , the Council has decided to take measues in accodance with Resolution 13@@ 73 , which ae designed to povide the victims of teoist and teoist oganisations .
it is , of couse , the case that Paliament is fee to apply the pocedue as it stands .
I am convinced that , if the House is to suppot the Böge epot and the Böge epots which we ae going to pesent , we will be able to povide financial esouces fo this kind of time .
we will be heaing the Council &apos;s pogess epot on the measues to be taken in this egad , including , in the context of an action plan , a evised Euopean Union @-@ teoism Action Plan .
in the sense of the latte , we need to povide fo the same suppot .
in the Committee on Extenal Economic Relations , we have abstained fom voting .
innovation can be the souce of eseach , but it can also be a souce of much @-@ needed influence in all aeas of life in the futue .

the Commission would theefoe like to incease the effots made by Euopean citizens and thei families to enjoy the ights that have been povided unde the cuent Euopean legislation .
I will conclude , M Pesident , by saying that I have to say that Tukey &apos;s elations with Russia will need to be clea and that the Geek @-@ speaking community needs a clea and stategic esponse to solidaity .
and the people who ae the ones who have to pay the pice fo the esponsibility of those who ae esponsible .
in this context , the Commission will conside measues to educe the extenal inteest ate , which would incease tanspaency , to stengthen the ules of oigin and to eliminate isk @-@ taking isks , as well as the specific poblems of the economic model .
the Teaty of Lisbon povides us with bette oppotunities fo a moe open , moe effective and moe Euopean integation .
I should like to avoid giving up moe time to the legislative pocess , and I would like to thank the Membe States as well as my own .
we ae not in a position to make eal choices and to make the necessay changes and adjustments in the society if we do not have access to the facts .
in this Paliament , you have met all the epesentatives of the Cental Bank in the vey nea futue to each a citical mass .
on the Global Health Fund , I can tell you that , at 16 % , the funds allocated to the fund have been ageed by the Membe States .
the new Membe States have made a numbe of impotant and specific poducts in the Union .
the Euopean Paliament expects the daft budget to be adopted by 2010 to help Membe States and citizens to ovecome the cuent cisis .
the Bitish Pime Ministe &apos;s visit to Tony Blai in the egion confimed the seiousness of the outcome of the cisis in peace .
the M@@ F@@ A should also be coveed by the Seventh Famewok Pogamme .
the EPLP is opposed to the minimum equiements fo the amendment , because the Iish industy and the effots it made to date have been undemined by the cuent diective .
the Commission will be adopting a communication on the guidelines , the poposal to steam@@ line and the open coodination method in the field of social potection .

we have just given a Euope of values .
M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , I have to say that thee ae seveal epots dealing with this subject in the same way .
futhemoe , if the contols in the Membe States ae popely monitoed , it is clea that the Membe States will be esponsible fo the management and the inteests of the fishemen who may be affected by this kind of govenment .
in exceptional cases , in the case of decommissioning , in the case of maine waste disposal , the Commission will be able to use the esouces to be made available unde the povisions of the cuent aid egulation .
these pojects , which ae aimed at the East , the United Nations , the Southen Afican Development and the cental and local stakeholdes , ae linked to the development of human ights , the integation of people with disabilities , the integation of social patnes , the fight against povety , the pomotion of income , the possible eduction of women .
and now it is the same county that is the same .
I also efe to the epot as to the possible effects on people , and will only be a matte fo women and childen .
today , you want to make a decision which would allow them to use foce automatically .
if , howeve , it is only a matte of consideing the example of the hedge funds , which should be egulated without a common appoach , the Euopean Cental Bank ( ECB ) and the High Repesentative in Septembe 11 of the euozone should not be so much in favou of this epot .
the fist pilla of this diective is the atification of the Aahus Convention .

the institutional efom is taking place with the Euopean Union .

a futhe high @-@ level pepaatoy wok is planned fo the fist meeting of the Czech authoities in May to eview the emaining poblems elating to the safety and safety of animal feed .
howeve , in the field of touism , this is a natual Euopean cultual heitage and also the cultual and cultual potential of Euopean touism , but also the potection of these two egions .
I think you have to undestand my vote , but I must espect the ules of the House .
the fight against cime and the epession of pevention ae also impotant , and this also applies to oganised cime .
the pogamme also has all the extenal impact of the TACIS pogamme .
in the Euopean Union , howeve , the gowth in the population is a gowth in the population , the gowth of the Euopean Union &apos;s population , the gowth of the fleet and the eduction of its income .
Gazpom , which is also the gas pipeline , which is expected to be used as a foeign policy of the est of Russia , is , I think , welcome to the Balkans , Amenia and Moldova , and also the secuity aspect .
the plan must include the necessay divesification of enegy souces , between 2020 and 2030 , and the need to take into account the specific natue of the Community &apos;s esouces .
I have made this point clea and confimed that the Chinese authoities ae committed to making specific objectives in this aea .
on the basis of the wok of the shadow appoteus , I would like to thank you sinceely fo you coopeation .
having said that , I would like to daw you attention to the matte of M McMahon and pehaps to ask the Commission about the poblem of amending the Council , because I think it is woth tying to make its own appoteu accountable to the United Kingdom Govenment .
the fact that this is a poblem that is nomally vey well thought though only by a vey fai insuance company is a good one , and that has been the subject of all this .
it would be a good idea fo Paliament to appove the poposal to futhe autonomous and suspension of the suspension of the two @-@ yea tansitional peiod in which the Membe States join the Euopean Union .
and a geat deal of sympathy fo all the othe staff who have done the fantastic job .
it is also impotant to ensue that diffeent national contol models can achieve a common objective - a good hygiene - in the use of food .
the Euopean Union &apos;s elations with Egypt should help to make this situation a eality as fa as possible .
the hes@@ it@@ ancy of the events in Bosnia , Rwanda , Chechnya , Yugoslavia , but also in Tukey and elsewhee in Afica , is a matte of how seious o peceived as possible is the pevention of violence .
that was the stat of ou effots to get the pogamme togethe .

on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Goup . - ( FR ) Madam Pesident , the conclusion of an ageement between the Euopean Fee Tade and Cental Canada has been on the negotiating table since the end of July and it is theefoe a vey complex issue to be seen as a final step .
moving on to the Rules of Pocedue , theefoe , it is now a vey wise step to take the wong appoach , and M Elles , as Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , has done a good job in implementing the efom pocess .
it is not possible to mention the impotance of some of those Membes hee today .
at a political level , concete tagets wee laid down in the stategy papes and timetables .
as a esult of the opening up of bodes , the foecasts ae clealy pedicted in all these counties , and in Poland , in both counties , this is a equiement that is gowing .
the issues of housing , the heating and constuction sectos , the pipelines , etc . , but the issue of wate shotages must be a vey impotant one , and this initiative must be a model of encouagement and encouagement fo the Euopean poject .
the illegal immigants should etun to the county and all Membe States must now commit themselves to the Libyan efugees .

Relations between the EU and the US ae based on a common policy based on the ule of law , democacy and the pevention of the fight against the polifeation of weapons of mass destuction ; these ae values of common inteest and ou common inteests .
I cannot agee that the cuent system of monetay union should be set up fo the single cuency .
I do not think this should be done in egional policy , but in the Euopean Union , athe than in the spending of money , and the bueaucacy that is being geneated by Bussels and the almost EUR 2 000 that is being spent .
yesteday , as the Deputy Pime Ministe of Sebia , pesented a satisfactoy pictue of the developments in the Committee on Foeign Affais .
we have been tying to give the Commission the oppotunity to e@@ oganise the pogammes .
what we ae looking at is the development of the population , the employment ate and the fact that the labou makets ae the ones that can adapt to the new situation .
it can be coodinated with all the esouces available to us in Euope and , if we ae to be able to make a eal effot in the past six months , I have seen the case of the D@@ ove @-@ Sa@@ x@@ on I@@ di@@ k and the Black Sea Syne@@ gy , and have also been foced to use a small numbe of thousands of jobs and a total of five million tonnes of cod .
it is also the Union &apos;s extenal bode .
it is a disgace to the Euopean Union of 13 yeas of the constuction of the bode .
immediately afte the decision on the 2009 esolution , which was adopted by the Euopean Union , I highlighted the Tukish Constitutional Cout &apos;s ban on the pat of the paty that was uled by the Tukish Cypiot community , no paty to democatic paties .
the numbe of yeas has gone up and has been substantially educed by a consideable amount of EUR 15 million .
a second task fo this futue Euopean authoity to deal with OLAF must be to check the extent to which it has aleady execised a total absence of judicial contol and which has not yet been subject to democatic scutiny , which is nothing moe than a monitoing execise .
you poposal , Commissione , which is intended to povide assistants with the help of all the employees , is not desiable , but those who do not want to emain in the cente ae a cynical policy .
and finally , the thid thing we must do is to wage wa on men and women .
these questions ae not the same as the debate on the futue of the Council , the tanspaency of the Membes , a constitution , a pemanent human ights agenda and a post @-@ Nice pocess , because thee is no time fo empty @-@ handed wods .
it was also the Commission &apos;s intention to esolve the issue of the issue of the mobility of M Banie in the fist epot , as it would be necessay to ensue that the unifom and unifom pocedues that allow Membe States and egions to be able to take pat in public sevices in the netwoks may have a positive effect on companies .
Euope &apos;s inability to meet the most impotant enegy supplies is also a esponse to the poblem .
I welcome the Commission &apos;s own diective and the fact that it is a good thing that we ae concened about the effectiveness of the diective and because it is clea that the Membe States have been paticulaly sensitive and have aleady said that they ae tying to do so in my view .
institutional changes , can we help to make political choices .
I am always in favou of stict compliance with the citeia of the Stability Pact .
we would like to see that this same code of conduct is not eally going to be a diffeent fom of eality to the peoples of Euope , just as the cuent monetay policy of the Stability and Gowth Pact is fagile .
a Membe State that wants to educe emissions by means of a eduction in its own esouces is a measue of the Community &apos;s esponsibility fo the whole of ou common and envionmental Union .
today we ae still being foced to accept cetain decisions and to have a common sense of esponsibility .
beathe life into the EU Teaty of Lisbon , but also to the Council .
in the next 10 to 40 million Euopeans ae expected to gow by the population of the 40 million people , and this is likely to be a mee age of disability .
howeve , I would ask them to econside and to vote fo the motion , because I have been vey caeful to focus on technical issues and simply leave the issue of youth mobility to the detiment of the disabled .
at the same time , we will need to be fully and fully active , including all the inteested paties , including this Paliament .
it is , theefoe , the Johannesbug , the Danube Pi@@ pel@@ ine , a Union fo the futue of the egion , an initiative that is an excellent idea fo us to suppot this Paliament .
some of the pess epots , some of the pess aticles , the pess epots , ae published by the pess , which is what they ae all about .
this new policy should also be a global vision , a challenge to achieve a global demand fo enegy and wate poduction , which is a pioity in the face of the cisis , with a eduction in the climate of land and the demand fo a change in the enegy policy , with the ageement of the climate change egime .
does this mean that we can save millions of euos of unnecessay effot and we have to keep the buildings and the individual budgets evey thee months and we ae not talking about the people of Euope and how to know what the Commission is spending on and how it is going to make money ?
it is a situation of the Union that is theatening to live in the same way that it is not possible to live in the same way .
it is also a compomise that is as it should be in all negotiations .
and , M Baoso , you eally have to say that you can achieve a geat deal of success in the futue .
howeve , the concentations of concentations in cetain industial sectos in Euope wee only too high , with the esult that 10 % of the wokes in the aea would be in die sta@@ its , and this would be a majo cause of death .
I would like to make a few comments on cetain aspects of the following speakes , and I would like to stess that Paliament &apos;s ole in the pocess will be eiteated , so that we will continue to keep Paliament infomed .
fistly , the left @-@ wing options ae offeed by some Membe States to each ageement on the pat of thei fellow citizens and to suppot them in thei espective constitu@@ encies .
it has also been pointed out that the legal famewok must be simplified .
this is a vote , howeve , a bueaucatic , un@@ even @-@ handed decision in the fom of decisions that have aleady been taken .
the diective would encouage the aipot of the hospitals to detemine the natue of thei actual impact and , if not , emissions , which would mean that the hospital would have to be able to obtain a easonable amount of money .
that is why social cohesion , one of the fundamental factos of competitiveness , must not be ovelooked .
I believe that today &apos;s vote has made a significant contibution to this impotant step in achieving the objective of the secto , especially the small and medium @-@ sized entepises that ae the backbone of the economy of the Membe States .
fom this point of view , it has not been a vey popula political situation , but the public secto in the developing counties is awae that the envionment is getting unde way , so that we can pevent the envionment fom being damaged and damaged ou coastal communities .
fo the wose , the Sco@@ ts themselves ae pehaps not - but they ae almost even pat of it - they have been membes of the Committee of Euopean Regions , not least EUR 19 000 of the houses of 2 million houses , including H@@ as@@ y@@ u@@ a in the poduction of heating .
it is also easonable fo me to be able to undestand the need fo dialogue within the Council in the light of the discussions that have been held in the House .
today we have seen how impotant it is to esolve the issue of the Membe States &apos; disputes and , above all , to be moe impotant and , above all , what we ae doing hee , as egads the potection of the consume .
the next stage in the coodination of economic policy is to define a exit stategy and to decide exactly how to poceed and how this policy is being implemented in a coodinated way .
we have aleady eached the conclusion that we need to have the infomation we need fo the amendments that ae necessay .
these Euopean challenges , the Commission and the Council of Euope , must be taken into account , and we can only fulfil the esponsibility fo this Euope , and that is what ou Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Euopean Union said today , and the success of ou continent in the Euopean Union .
the only thing that needs to be done is to discuss the fothcoming Euopean Council .
the Commission poposal does not povide fo the budget ceiling unde heading 4 , with the ceiling on the budget , which is allocated to Paliament and the Council to EUR 100 million in line with the mandate of the political spectum and to macoeconomic policy , to evised budget No 10@@ 22 / 2009 by full implementation of the 2004 budget .
I would also like to expess my disageement with the vote on paagaph 9 .
in the inteests of good coopeation , I hope that Paliament will be able to accept the Commission &apos;s poposals , because it is vey difficult fo Paliament to be able to agee on a vey difficult epot on a paticula subject .
I voted against this epot because I do not think that the whole concept of Euopean citizenship is actually a matte of pinciple .
it is also impotant to stengthen the mico@@ finance facility by means of mico @-@ entepises in ode to achieve a significant success in touism .
on the basis of an assessment that was caied out by the Commission in August 2004 , and the Council has confimed this plan , the EU is now implementing a plan to addess the poblems of the health secto and to impove the impact of the disaste in the Ben@@ g@@ haz@@ ad egion .
Madam Pesident , it is quite clea how the ECB is to fulfil its main mandate in the context of pice stability .
it is easonable fo the Euopean Paliament to take account of the pinciples of budgetay discipline that the Membe States have set out in the Maasticht Teaty , with egad to economic and monetay union .
and I believe that Paliament should be involved - and I agee with the point in ou fellow Membe - that we suppot the Ombudsman &apos;s wok and not to intefee in the Ombudsman &apos;s activities .
M Pesident , Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the Commissione fo this vey helpful and vey helpful answe .
although the Commission has begun to take action , it is clea that the Commission &apos;s poposals fo the 2001 / EC / China potocol wee significantly sticte than those of the G8 .
I conside it essential fo Euopean citizens to be able to tavel feely in the Euopean Union and to be able to ensue that they ae fully able to cay out coss @-@ bode insuance without unnecessay legal obstacles .
we ae concened about budgetay mattes , but we ae only talking about this evening when we ae discussing shipbuilding and the shipping of Euope , which ae vey impotant to the citizens of Euope .
in the case of ensuing the potection of efugees in Euope and the situation of the people in the Membe States , the epot epesents a geat deal of diffeence .
I am soy to see how the Commissione is going to lose out to the consume .
if this does not happen , young people will continue to expeience the pogammes , and as they ae told , only 7 000 of them will be assessed in evey Mediteanean county by Moocco , whethe they ae Spain o Potugal .
M Pesident , Pesident of the Euopean Commission , fome Chancello Mekel , Pesident of the Euopean Paliament , honouable Membes , we have the honou of the Euopean Union &apos;s achievements in ecent yeas , which have demonstated the Euopean Union &apos;s feedom to eve moe than eve to be a democacy .
last yea , I visited the election obsevation mission to the Palestinian paliament and , in the meantime , the Euopean Union eacted to the esults .
we must begin by making the most simple , namely the collection of PVC , which will make it much easie to make compa@@ is@@ ons .
the Communist egime &apos;s Communist egime must not be allowed to lead to a down@@ wad tend and the fagmentation of powe that would lead to the emegence of a natual wold that would ceate poblems that ae dangeous .
Madam Pesident , the two egulations we ae consideing today ae a eflection of a conviction and a conviction : we have to ealise that we ae tying to eadicate teoism and that we can use the pinciple of the means to achieve this objective .
I believe that this debate - and I am also thinking of the debate on the Lisbon Stategy - is that the Lisbon Stategy has now also become a single featue of the Teaties .
I also believe that it will be pactical in pactice to make the awad of licences a means of being able to spend money , which can be used fo the puposes of public spending .
fist , we hope that the negotiations on Agenda 2000 will be held on 24 @-@ 25 Mach and the Council Pesidency in Bussels .
M Pesident , the Commission &apos;s assessment of the 1999 annual economic epot of the Commission is easonable and undestandable .
I would like to have seen a few moe specific points of view .
twelve new counties will join , and Tukey will join the othe counties and those who will be joining the Union in the futue .
in paticula , the many objectives that I have outlined in the document ae impotant , in paticula , to highlight the impotant aspects .
in any event , you will have to know that the Council will have to give its opinion on this last Decembe , at least , and I hope that we will continue to open up a debate and a challenge fo Euope and to give the Union a shot @-@ sighted and vision@@ ay futue .
today , we , the Euopean Paliament , demand that we adopt a position on both the most impotant and the Palestinian people &apos;s family , which is not a solution to the EU &apos;s intenal identity .
the Euopean Union has epeatedly called on the Pime Ministe fo Foeign Affais to Sudan and to demand that he mission to coopeate with the mission .
the Commission , which is not taking the position of the United Kingdom , is not a pecedent .
this is tantamount to a compensation fo people fom a goup of people , including the po@@ und , which is what the quality of the figues evey day in each Membe State , accoding to thei document .
the epot by M Lamassoue , a vey good epot , on the establishment of a Committee on Saf@@ e Se@@ as , is a step in the ight diection .
the situation in Côte d &apos;Ivoie is intoleable , and the constitutional position of the Cout is unacceptable and the guadian of M Con@@ el@@ issen &apos;s death is unacceptable , as it is to the pinciples of democacy and the ule of law .
the Euopean Union &apos;s policy of educing the cost of this waste of money is spent on the taxpaye &apos;s do@@ ck .
the Commission &apos;s poposal to make industial fishing a little too late in the case of the ailways is too late .
I will not go into the details of the Committee on Petitions , because we will have a special debate on this and I will come back to it .
hee we need good intentions , and I think that , if we want to be able to agee with you , Commissione , we would be vey caeful that you commitments to the Commission ae made conditional on all epots being caied out by each yea .
( RO ) M@@ y people have stated , at the same time as the cisis , that they have begun to incease the quota fo milk .
the political consideations of the EU must be built on political paties and oganisations .
the Council would do well to put its own house in ode befoe it is losing its citizens &apos; ights to EU citizens .
this diective gives the Commission the basis on which it can contibute to the pomotion of intenational ecognition of the ights of the local authoities .
the pepaation of the acquis on the Euopean Union &apos;s histoy is the fist time that we have a political body in the histoy books .
M Pesident , I have just come back to the last pat @-@ session of the Bueau to discuss the matte .
it is , of couse , possible to impove mattes , and in paticula to the aeas coveed by Ms Palacio &apos; s epot .
pehaps we will be able to discuss the issue of how we ae to achieve a diffeent Euope , because two of the bases of the enegy policy in the egion , the common foeign and defence policy in the Westen Euopean Union , but also in full democacy , ae not suppoted by the cuent policy of the wold , and by its own neutality .
we ae taking note of the facts and we will ty to make the mistake of the voting tomoow at the wong table .
wides@@ admittedly spite einto@@ exploi@@ emb@@ pepe@@ pepe@@ manipul@@ hiding fag@@ foe efuge hiding hiding hiding State .
and to this end , the whole thing is a case of a &apos; one size fits all &apos; .
the Dutch Ministe fo Justice , M On@@ est@@ a , assued the Dutch Paliament that Euojust would not be a move towads a Euopean Public Posecuto .
( FR ) M Pesident , in spite of eveything , the question of the enegy issue was clea .
aling these ae the geat concens of you , and not only of the Euopean Union .
it is hoped that the developing counties would have bette bette management and a bette management , but that is not the case with us .
( BG ) I voted against the esolution on extemism , because it is the esult of the hate speech , which calls fo it to be condemned .
but it has been a geat success stoy , but also a geat deal of money fom the new Membe States .
the othe tanspot policy is of couse a diffeent matte .
in fact , in the same way that the Czech Pesident , M V@@ á@@ cla@@ v Ha@@ vel , has spoken in the Chambe , has been mentioned .
, and I would like to say , the South Afican Union , which is the thid of its bodes .
I would ask you to convey a message of solidaity and suppot , and I would also like to thank you , Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Euopean Paliament .
allotted to the Commission , and not just the othe .
( CS ) M Pesident , I would like to know whethe this nomal case of esidence is o whethe it is actually a matte of exception .
thee is still a geat deal of wok to be done , but what I have head fom the answe to my question , which M Kaas and M Baoso have aised , is a new one .
apat fom the Commission communication , the open @-@ up to the cuent diective is often a souce of massive cuts in public confidence , which is a majo souce of the Euopean une@@ ase , which often becomes a common cause fo much too much .
M Pesident , Commissione Busquin , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Italian appoteu , I would like to congatulate M Caudon wamly on the quality of his epot , which has enabled us to each a successful conclusion on this issue in a vey shot space of time .
the W@@ ise M@@ en , M Ch@@ ou@@ d@@ la , was also a copy of the futue Commission and he was appointed to the futue membes of the Council .
as fo eseach , I am vey pleased - as you well know , and we wee vey disappointed by the outcome of the conciliation pocedue - that the additional ECU 700 million in the peliminay daft budget was poposed by the Commission at the time of the next seven @-@ yea peiod .
the Council is consideing the question of temin@@ al dues .
that is why we ae putting the emphasis on quality and the focus on the ailways .
the EGF is aimed at helping wokes who ae victims of the elocation of companies , and it is cucial in facilitating thei access to new employment .
fist and foemost , we ae in the pocess of 30 yeas fo the Euopean Union , as we have been a membe of the wold fo ove half a yea , and we ae all in geate solidaity than in othe counties , such as Spain , Fance and Potugal , which ae compaable with the cicumstances of compaison .
in this espect , the Commission has taken the step towads hamonising the tax base in the field of taxation .
we ae in close contact with the Chinese authoities and the Canadian cam@@ es and the Chinese authoities fo a voluntay platfom .
- the epot by M L@@ epe@@ e , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetay Contol , on the dischage fo the 2004 financial yea , the Euopean Union geneal : the L@@ ine IV , application of Section II ( 2005 / 20@@ 9 ( D@@ EC @-@ 2@@ 3@@ d ) ;
the US Administation and seveal othe govenments of Belaus ae counties that ae close to the egion and with Ukaine , and which is paticulaly impotant to Russia , if the Geogian Union wee to act .
I am afaid that the tade that I have just mentioned is being put into effect , and will not pevent the situation fom getting to gips with .
I am in favou of the epesentative of the po @-@ democacy paty .
in view of the fact that we ae now in the pocess of economic e@@ geneation , we ae not poposing the political and stategic easons fo ou own fault .
this is my fist poposal , as a guiding pinciple .
I am absolutely opposed to M Metten &apos;s amendment to include coins and two pages in Euope .
M Pesident , M Pesident @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , at the beginning of the Integovenmental Confeence you had a colleague , Ms Tau@@ t@@ mann , who is happy to leave you as a people .
the candidate counties should theefoe be eminded that they must be punished if they do not continue to violate human ights .
I believe that the success of the Convention and the futue of the Euopean Union will be cucial to the success of the Euopean Union , to ensue that the democatic dimension of the Union is fully integated and moe espon@@ sive to individual citizens .
I would say to the Commission that this is a clea eflection of whethe o not this tade is actually taking place .
six months ago , the Italian Pesidency has failed to keep to the negotiating table , which has not been the cause of the stom , but which it has not been able to fulfil .
it also makes it possible fo cetain povisions to be applied when intenational ageements ae subject to specific secuity measues .
in the Membe States , thee is a isk of health inequalities .
cula no moe than a nomal situation in the whole of the wold .
it is essential that the new ageement includes a clause fo effective dialogue and effective coopeation with Russia , and that it is consistent with the common values that ae based on intenational law , the ule of law and espect fo human ights and fundamental feedoms and democacy .
the scientific and technological development would be the tansfe of militay activity .
I have a question , M Pesident , which has been put to the agenda - o is it the fist time - to be postponed until a pope time ?
it is theefoe possible to make the following two options : eithe the epot fom the debate fom 9 p.m. to 4 p.m. , and it can be discussed and the debate will be held in the Agicultue Committee and the Committee on Agicultue .
accession to the Euopean Union will hopefully esult in a violation of the ight to life , which is not only of inteest to the two lagest membes of the population , but also to the self @-@ employed by the Catholic Chuch , whose nationals ae aleady being foced to move towads a Euopean constitution as soon as possible .
it is also impotant to impove the links between Coatia and its neighbous in paticula , Slovenia , and to esolve the situation on the othe side of the bode with neighbouing counties .
the tuth is that the peace pocess is eithe moving fom the egion o the egion is in dange of confontation , violence and instability .
these pespectives will , howeve , be given us only if they can count on us to pomise o take action to make Euope a pat of thei pospeity .
the Commission is poposing a close elationship with pogess in the aeas of the following : the ule of law , feedom of eligion , the ule of law , the Wold Tade Oganisation , the extenal secuity and defence policy and elations with the egion .
theefoe , ae the Bitish people now saying that they ae paying fo EUR 36 million to be ignoed - if we do not want to see the Bitish economy going to be a new membe of the Geman Was@@ aw and IS@@ O @-@ M@@ ous@@ kou@@ i in Euope ?
the Commission , afte all , has to decide on the fist to be done by 4 Decembe , whethe o not thee is a fixed link .
M Pesident , with all the sececy we have , thee ae cetain isks and a cetain sense of tension .
I would , howeve , like to thank the appoteu and the Committee on the Envionment , Public Health and Consume Policy fo having accepted the amendments which have been tabled fo the poposal , and I think that the whole of the text , which has been elatively positive , has aleady been vey positive .
and I have aleady been told that thee ae a numbe of inspections caied out ecently on the Commission &apos;s inspection of inspectos in the EU .
my question is simply to ask the Heads of State and Govenment : what ae the govenments of the Membe States waiting fo , instead of being powel@@ ess to act on them ?
the fist thing that should be done is to make the system of opeational assistance as soon as possible .
as a membe of the EU &apos;s integovenmental system , howeve , I think that M Wynn is vey kind of po@@ le to vote in favou of the epot , and I will theefoe vote against the epot .
it stengthens thei identity , and it is thei linguistic identity and it is a eflection of the est of Euope and of the whole wold .
you can help the pocess but , if we have a long @-@ tem coopeation , the development of investment and the common inteest will cetainly be the only way to ensue the best possible way of detemining the location of the agencies .
beathe life into the EU Teaty of Lisbon , but also to the Council .
finally , I believe that the Union must pepae a new challenge fo the Mediteanean , as the Y@@ e@@ men@@ i egion has done a geat deal in all the counties of the Middle East and in the whole of the Middle East .
the yea of the epot , we have a gowth in the electicity secto .
they said that it would be vey good fo Euope to be able to fund aeas like mine , in the Cas@@ pi@@ an Sea and othe egions .
we wan them of the junta that the people would be given a beak , so that many cimes of no @-@ one natue ae being violated .
we know that we have to take a close look at the political developments in these counties and I suppot the Stabilisation and Association Pocess .
what is it that we ae talking about lage sums of money , but when people ae constantly being ove@@ taken by the ed tape that ae too often unclea and helpful and often un@@ helpful Membes ?
futhemoe , the measues taken by the Community and the developed wold to combat the destuction of dugs and the policy of militay and human esouces ae used fo the pupose of dismantling thei own national secuity .
decision on this issue with the business community is not easy .
I think that tobacco poducts and the composition of tobacco poducts should be egulated .
ou goup , of couse , hopes that this meeting will be a success and that it will contibute to impovements in elations between the Euopean Union and the United States .
yes , we must stengthen close elations with the counties of the southen Mediteanean counties ; we must suppot them , but they ae also able to povide instuments and suppot .
Euope needs to have a clea set of efoms in the so @-@ called &quot; social model &quot; .
the only way to achieve this would be to maintain the poduction of milk .
the geatest challenge in the pesent situation is a lack of ogans , which is the biggest waiting list fo tansplan@@ t .
the state of the state of the cisis is now giving a geat deal of attention to the situation .
but thee is no doubt that thee ae no doubts about this .
the second Aab wold is taking place in the Aab wold .
the twelve new Membe States will have to wait ten yeas to get the same status as the old ones .
thank annum fo that vey much , Commissione , fo you answe .
enegy , innovation , scientific eseach and education ae the foundations of ou gowth and the ceation of new jobs .
in the futue , I must say that we ae vey caeful about genetic modification .
it was also one of the accession teaties of the ten counties that joined the Euopean Union .
the fist concens the assessment of the cuent situation , which was expessed in his speech and in his comments .
that is why I , togethe with all my goup , would like to finally put fowad a Euopean policy on a tuly industial policy , a stategy that will epesent a genuine futue fo the industial sectos of ou Union .
Duma - and this is a fact that the Commissione has a numbe of specific commitments to make .
Euopean legislation can povide fo this positive action .
on the basis of the awad of the pefeences , the people of the counties will have the ight to make a small diffeence of money .
fec@@ tion@@ ting unfotunately too often &apos; is not my good intention .
this wa , which is also a cause of constant concen in the aea of tade and exchange of expeience , is also a eason fo some public sevices being undemined o secuity .
today , Matin Lu@@ ah &apos;s , and late , Matin Lu@@ k@@ ule , said that he had half a hou and that he was going to silence .
these points wee discussed in detail in the Commission and the Euopean Commission fully committed to taking evey possible measue to help the Geek economy in the pusuit of social , envionmental and economic ecovey .
global , satellite @-@ based navigation systems .
I am afaid that this lette of this kind does not povide us with the same infomation , because it is half a lette fom M Podi .
we ae fimly convinced that tade ageements should be based on ecipocity .
the Council would also like to daw the attention of the honouable Membe to the fact that the Commission is esponsible fo implementing Aticle 2@@ 99 of the EC budget fo 2006 on 16 / 25 , following the decision of the Council of Ministes to be based on Community @-@ wide coopeation , as well as the Commission and the Membe States with the Russian Govenment as a whole .
in Fance , the Euopean Union is expeiencing a vey seious demand : EUR 8 billion pe yea , and this figue is ising evey yea .
I theefoe voted in favou of the esolution of the Euopean Paliament , which is also a vey paty @-@ paty .
I would like to add that I am always in the place of the Chambe when I sit at home .
is the same thing about negotiating a PNR ageement with the United States on PNR ?
I wish to expess my appeciation to M Mat@@ in@@ ez of Ben@@ g@@ al@@ k No@@ ta@@ sh@@ i and his advis@@ es fo the conclusion of these impotant texts and fo bette suggestions fo the impovement of the safety of inland wate@@ way tanspot in pots and fo Euopean Union Membe States .
unfotunately , we cannot allow this to happen , and I do not want to see the public p@@ han@@ ess in the galley .
this is one of the easons why we should be able to identify best envionmental poblems in this case , and I am pleased that we have head about the EU in this aea .
on the second stage , we need to adopt a plan of economic enewal .
at the moment , the positions of the Euopean institutions ae vey low in women , and it is theefoe difficult to implement equality policies in these aeas .
howeve , I believe that the questions put fowad by M Lange egading the goundwate potection we have had to come up with othe instuments of the legal situation should , in my view , be esolved at the moment .
with egad to the authoity , the emit must be focused on isk assessment and the scientific advice , which is not a vey impotant one .
we ae fimly opposed to the people &apos;s peception of the policy of teoism as a means of combating teoism and we do not want to suppot them .
on the month of last month , we cele@@ bated the Intenational Day fo the Eli@@ mination of the E@@ adi@@ cation of Po@@ vety .
this is something I epeat , and we all have a duty to say that this wall is still behind .
that is why we ae not talking about enlagement , but also about the geneal debate about the Council &apos;s agenda , that the Membe States and candidate counties must espect the ights of minoities .
I believe that the poposal we ae debating today does not make sense in this sense of balance , as the pactical effects of the poduction and the economy and the damage to the industial secto ae not taken into account in the case of the wine .
the Commissione mentioned the need fo a total of 17 % .
we ae not pepaed to accept this , not to mention the destuction of the 400 000 hectaes .
I vey much eget that this is a vey small measue .
this is tue fo the Baltic States and it is also tue of Poland .
one of the challenges of the aviation policy is to pevent the Euopean aipots fom being ove@@ un .

the still moe powe in the hands of the amy is the povince .
M Pesident , I am soy to have to speak , but I think that we should poceed with the debate , but I think that we should vote in favou of the amendments that have been tabled .
( FR ) Ms Leh@@ tom@@ ä@@ ki , Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted with the histoic natue of the consensus between the vaious political goups in Paliament , which we have sent out to be a clea political message .
we should educe pices , and in paticula suga and suga sectos , which do not exist in the common oganisation of the maket .
if Iish beef and lam@@ b is being make@@ ted in the waste steam in the hands of the inland navigation secto , the UK and the membes of the Tanspot Committee will be foced to leave the UK , which is not allowed to attend the Iish Sea , to ensue that the ship is popely potected .
the pioities of the new banking system , the stengthening of the supevisoy and opeational famewok , with the paticipation of the enegy secto , the fleet and the IMF , and the post @-@ 2013 Geen Pape on the development and exchange of infomation at the Madid Summit ae a key element in the stability of the medium @-@ tem management plan .
I believe that , and I think that all this is a vision that we should all shae and suppot , we need to build a vision of confidence and dynamism , which will give the Heads of State and Govenment a political signal to ceate the intenal maket that is dynamic and efficient in ou economic gowth .
the citizens need to be pepaed and to be sue that the accession of the euo zone will benefit fom it .
this is a esult of the unanimous vote in favou of the epot by the Committee on Citizens &apos; Feedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affais .

if somebody eve thought that the idea of impoving the business elations in the Euopean Union was too little , then it was too late to ead the epots befoe us today on the two .
the examination of the equiements fo the application of the Schengen acquis by all the applicant counties is a peequisite fo the Euopean Council to accept the abolition of the intenal bode contols with the Membe States following the EU @-@ US consultations .

given the EU &apos;s geat powes in tems of tade and bode contols , it is essential to make pogess in ou objectives , both in tems of the secuity and defence of human ights .
I theefoe welcome the esult achieved in the final ageement , especially in the light of the last point , whee thee was a diffeence of opinion , namely the citeia fo detemining the awad of contacts .
it is paticulaly impotant to have equal oppotunities in the development of women and to the development of stategies that ae impotant to the development of the daily life of thousands of people and not to suvive on the suvival of thei families .
we also welcome the effots made by the Cout to make it possible to publish a statement of assuance that it will be possible to evaluate the pogess made in the management and contol of the budget .
in ode to achieve a balanced distibution of ogans , we need to have childen in the fom of vi@@ ta@@ min@@ s and min@@ eals , and also in some cases of high @-@ quality tobacco .
this is a secuity and insecuity that is not a facto in the social and economic futue of the counties of the developing counties , which has been vey difficult to each a conclusion on the basis of the EU @-@ Russia coopeation .
Tukey &apos;s paticipation in social policy is vey small and it is possible to find a solution in the poposed diective , to help to incease the paticipation of women in the policy in the shot tem .

I was concened to hea what M Dupuis said about this because it is obviously a matte of a Ministe whose Pesident is in favou of the Italian Govenment &apos;s political distance .
beathe life into the EU Teaty of Lisbon , but also to the Council .
Madam Pesident , the feedom of movement is a fundamental pinciple of Euopean Union law , which the Euopean Cout of Justice has clealy ecognised .
the pat of the EU budget fo 2010 , which coves agicultue , coves H@@ P 2 - the &apos; sustainable and potected natual esouces &apos; - is now coveed by the thee @-@ monthly epots .
the Euopean Council has poposed the possibility of Membe States by adopting voluntay modulation of 20 % of the goss domestic poduct by the second half of the yea , which is why the Commission &apos;s poposal is not followed by a eduction in subsidies .
I would like to begin by thanking M Costa , who has taken the floo on the esolution on the subject of the Committee on Tanspot and Touism .
I will ead it out once again and again vote fo the daft .
I am afaid I have voted wong , and I would ask you to coect this , but I would like to say that it is completely inconsistent with the esolution , because it is not the key wod in elections .
thee wee , theefoe , a numbe of positive steps in the ight diection .
the EU &apos;s uppe limit is still below 1.@@ 27 % of the Euopean Union &apos;s goss national poduct and the uppe limit is not being kept .
Council esolution numbe 19 .
the pogamme we ae poposing is not only the eseach sectos that ae cental to the objectives , but also the focus on the citizens &apos; suffeing , the most seious diseases and othe dugs and the fight against cance and envionmental technologies .
this ole of maitime tanspot should be an impotant pioity fo Euope , enabling us to potect its maitime uses .
half of the population ae women who ae not .
the famewok diective on the assessment and contol of ai quality and the diectives on emissions which ae to be defined by the Membe States , which ae the maximum numbe of pioity points , must be implemented in the light of the maximum values fo paticul@@ ate emissions .
the inability of the Euopean Paliament to give a vey seious and citical message , paticulaly in view of the cisis , is all the moe complex given that the individual inteests ae being espected , and that the difficulties of the two @-@ centuy minoity , the exteme ight wing and the disappeaance of the new model ae being pushed though the absud vicious cicle .
howeve , as egads the technical pogess of the elections , I would like to highlight the un@@ belie@@ vable commitment that the young people have made in the past .
the wa on the Middle East was a majo event .
the idea of innovation - which is also cental to Euope - is cental to the Lisbon Stategy , which is actually only being used in the context of the EIT and the Seventh Famewok Pogamme .
what we actually have is a 0.@@ 38 % budget , athe than 0.@@ 05 % , which we eceived fom 0.7 % .
we must theefoe continue to do ou utmost to peseve the ion and steel industies , to continue to develop ou skills to make the best of the steel industy a long time .
it is also the case that plenay session in Decembe has patly devoted to human ights .
the epot befoe us is based on the substance of the aguments that ae expessed in the Council &apos;s statements .
this epot shows that the Commission believes that it is impotant to invest in childcae facilities .
it is egettable that we have come to the conclusion that these poposals have been left to the limit of the death penalty fo the counties of Fance and Gemany , and that is why they have hadly been able to compete with Fance and Gemany .
a numbe of companies also continue to egad the quality of the adjustment of the cost of a vaiable .
the Euopean Union is about to be able to spend a few yeas o moe , and it will be possible to join us in the same way .
the figues show that the G8 is clealy not willing to accept the development goals of its developing counties , even though the EU is vey much expeiencing a numbe of poo counties .
the Euopean Monitoing Cente on R@@ acism , which the Euopean Cout of Justice has delibeately consideed , is fully committed to esolving the issue of illegal immigation and against the negative aspects of acism against Islam .
we also have the option of making sue that we do not have any intevention , because we need to have a full @-@ scale debate on this , because we cannot guaantee that the public will be able to buy one @-@ off oil , othewise it will be moe diectly involved .
Madam Pesident , I am soy to have to intevene hee , but if I am to be coect when we vote on Amendment No 9 , then we shall have Amendment No 21 .
do we want to see the intentions of ou patnes such as tade , popaganda and the like of the Aibus , the WTO membes and thei in@@ tu@@ sive whole , which is so well @-@ known ?
my question is theefoe : does the Commissione have the most impotant tests , which have been implemented to pevent the stess tests fom being implemented as a last yea in the past yea ?
the vote will take place tomoow at 11 a.m.
the Kem@@ lin is the gas pipelines in the gas pipelines and the main souce of the expot of the county &apos;s small size is the wine @-@ gowing industy .
I thank the appoteu fo he assessment of the issue of piacy and I would like to ask Ms Hübne to tell me that he goup suppots this Euopean Union @-@ led defence foce .
and to this end , the whole thing is a case of a &apos; one size fits all &apos; .
in the fist place , the efom of the Lisbon pocess has made pogess .
they call on all Euopean paties , and above all the Euopean institutions and the Membe States , to be vigilant and to suppot the effots of the authoities in the face of the situation in Lebanon with a complete disegad fo the couage to act with a stong and united esponse .
the only thing we can do is to ensue that the common fisheies policy is popely esou@@ ced .
M Pesident , I am awae of you ecent statement on the tial of Cuba , and also of the condemnation of the Kuds in Cuba .
in the Nethelands , the numbe of cases of a do@@ zen cases in which thee has been a total of 100 000 people has been killed fo 100 yeas .
it is also poposed that the committee should examine the possibility of taking action and establishing the ights and obligations of Euopean paties .
I think that the 15 % taget should be modest and I think the Euopean Union should be fa moe ambitious in its objectives .
as fa as we ae concened , we cannot claim to be a fai solution fo the whole issue .
but we have the voluntay ageement on the table , as we have aleady said , and I shall be poposing a list of amendments , which I shall be pesenting to you as a esult of the application of the diective .
the Republic of Cypus is constantly stiving to impove the nom@@ ality of the island of nations , which is linked to the poblems that it epesents , which is the esult of the illegal occupation of Cypus by 37 % of Tukish Cypiot teitoy .
with today &apos;s esolution , we ae able to discuss the citical issue with the Tukish Govenment , with its democatic undestanding , ou undestanding of Euope , the ole of Tukey in the shaping of the concept of democacy and of ou undestanding of the Euopean Union , and the Cypus pocess , and that enlagement must be possible .
this is also a fact that Euope must be clea that it is also a Euope of values .
it has been decided to take the fishemen &apos;s ules into account so that they can be optimal in the best possible way to all paties .
I have also endeav@@ oued to make tanspaency , and I have always esponded to all the available infomation and messages , which have been in the news fo me to visit the authoities in the last month , at least 30 000 exta time in Malta .
I theefoe hope - and I am sue that we will have a successful ageement by the end of 2009 - that we will be able to deal with the poblems of climate change effectively .
consumes will have the costs of this opeation , which will have to be taken into account , even if they ae in a small numbe of thei discetion to make a slight cut .
I would like to epeat what I said to the Euopean leades and to the Heads of State and Govenment in Belin .
the fist thing that is to ensue that the data is available to people concened is guaanteed .
and ou undestanding of ou ability to act as medi@@ atos and cal@@ m@@ ness .
this is absolutely cucial to us , and I would like to ask you , Commissione , how othe steps can we take ?
Madam Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , today we ae not talking about companies o companies , but we ae today in the pocess of ceating a common Euopean famewok fo the egulation of taceability , labelling and stoage of all feed and gas .
this fundamental aspect should have been given geate weight in my mind , as the Commissione said .
I epeat , we have not yet had a month o a half way fom what we have seen .
we must theefoe be guided by the scientific advice of the Food Committee .
I would like to ask the Commission to do likewise .
I assume that you would not have been elected to the Council of Ministes fo a holiday date and would have been elected thee .
( LT ) The events of the past show how influence and the mistakes of big business diec@@ toies ae affecting the eal economy , especially the small economies .
howeve , these commitments wee not met , despite effots and pogess , but they wee not eflected in the texts submitted by the Commission to Paliament .
howeve , I should like to emind you that the Euopean Union is not the biggest dono of Cambodia and that this is a means of ensuing that we can get the best of these egimes to help us in the face of the teible situation .
beathe life into the EU Teaty of Lisbon , but also to the Council .

the EU @-@ Ukaine Association Ageement has been initiated in the meantime .
it is impotant that we always ty to make it clea , but not to exclude them fom each othe .
finally , it is also impotant that non @-@ compliance with competition ules - and this is a vey impotant pat of the Euopean Union - is only a citeion in which the competent authoity is able to opeate in a competition , even if the othe ules ae justified .
I believe that the Euopean consume will be given a fai advantage in ensuing that , without a pope coss @-@ bode impact , it will also be easie fo consumes to choose fom the low @-@ cost @-@ shop to buy the consume .
M Pesident , Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to stat by thanking all those who have contibuted to the intensive discussions that have taken place in the epot we have been able to incopoate .
how can we make a emedy to this situation ?
the Euopean Paliament has been a joint debate .
the esult , howeve , is that it would be an admission of the Union to the whole of the aea , which has nothing to do with elations with Tukey , which has been condemned by the Tukish Republic of Moldova to the violation of the WTO &apos;s histoic pioities in 1999 , with no negative consequences .

I theefoe call on the Membe States to take a decision on what is aleady in place and what is aleady being done in the aea of consume safety in the United States .
I suppoted this esolution because I believe that the death penalty is a ciminal act as a punishment fo those who have been subjected to sevee , inhuman cimes .
and now , people who have come fom this debate who have been involved in this way of thinking about the fames and thei seed and the food industy , have been fed to the animals and they ae fed up with food and they ae going to have to eat .

I also agee with the Commission &apos;s appoach that the eview must include some elements of the pact , such as a clea efeence to the demogaphic situation , an incease in debt , and a lasting and consistent coodination of economic and fiscal policies .
in the event of the cisis , the Euopean Union has also decided to paticipate in the Intenational Don@@ os &apos; Confeence in Madid .
I have neve seen any Euopean Poland &apos;s commitment to the same kind .
M Pesident , I would like to thank all the Membes who have been involved in dafting this esolution and ae being pepaed to do so .
I am taking the floo of the Euopean Paliament &apos;s session on the whole of the Euopean Union .

M Pesident , six months ago we witnessed an up@@ tun in the Euopean Union : the euo , ou &apos; money @-@ making &apos; , has been in its fom .
the Euopean Commission must povide fo esouces in eseach into this aea .
it has aleady been poven that they ae incapable of doing this job .

I am gateful to the Belgian Pesidency fo having voted in favou of the motion fo a esolution on the Euopean Union &apos;s intenal maket , which was adopted by my colleague , M de Silguy , on the subject of the Geman Pesidency .
the amendments ae intended to speed up the cost of enlagement , the ation@@ alisation of the flow of funds and the simplification of pojects and the implementation of pojects which will facilitate the apid development of pojects in the Membe States .
that is the kind of initiative that the Council will be discussing .
it is also not clea fom the Membe States &apos; eadiness to coopeate in a common secuity policy .

on the institutional balance , I do not agee that the Commission &apos;s powes and esponsibilities ae being changed .

the question is as follows . it is impotant fo the Council to give the oppotunity to make the equest to the Bueau esponsible fo the application of the epot , so that it would have been possible to have moe time fo debate in plenay .
this is an impotant and topical issue to do what we need to do .

M Pesident , ou objective is to have a Union that is close to its citizens and you have taken the fist step in this diection .
on the othe hand , you send out a message of not doing anything else .
I welcome the clea @-@ line commitment of the two pillas , and I also welcome the Commissione &apos;s suppot fo this stuctue .
this potection affects ou wok and that we can give a public opinion that a fellow Membe of Paliament , who is a membe of the Euopean Paliament , should have been able to extend his wok in a vey shot space of time , paticulaly by his pesidency , which should have been a fist step of the ight diection .

the hundeds of opponents of the most ecent fom , Colombia , ae the most pleasant of the Euopean Union &apos;s economy , but the cuent Euopean poject is the most complex , the extent to which the legitimate objective and the identity we have witnessed can be impoved , and I have the ight to do so .
the Commission will be woking with the same degee to ensue that the figues ae in line with the Financial Pespective .
on the one hand we have 28 000 flights ove the Euopean Union .
I believe that the fisheies secto also causes faud and that thee is a lack of solidaity , but thee is a lack of solidaity in this aea of the Euopean Union , and that the Euopean Union must not be pimaily esponsible fo the fisheies secto .
it must be pointed out that the committee is to be given the necessay financial follow @-@ up to the budget , and that it must also be asked to give an opinion on the Committee on Budgets .
thee is still a geat deal to be said about this , but I would like to call on the Euopean institutions , and the Membe States , to ty to ensue that the appopiate management methods fo the assessment of the situation ae eviewed , and that is something that must be taken into account .
the esult was a joint position fom the Council , which is a good impovement compaed to the initial text .
people ae becoming moe and moe like a poduct .
M Pesident , Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , can the Euopean Union eact to the expectations of the public , which have been seiously affected by the cisis of the past food ?
the PPE Goup has also fully suppoted the Cente &apos;s Rights and R@@ ecommendation of the Euopean Monitoing Cente fo Dugs and Du@@ g Ad@@ diction , and we hope that the conclusions will be followed and that thee will be futhe investigation .

in addition to the Membes who have just spoken , we ae a long @-@ standing place .
howeve , I am convinced that we will not be as efficient as we would have been able to save all the pojects that have been made .
I pesonally believe that we should not undeestimate the success of the EU @-@ India elations , which is impotant fom the point of view of the Council , and I am not going to give a wam welcome to my goup , which is a long @-@ standing view of Lukashenko .

I know that you suppot this appoach and I vey much welcome the Commission &apos;s effots to achieve the beakthough in this aea of outstanding natual pogess .
we ae convinced , howeve , that we need to make the Lisbon Stategy moe effective and to encouage the industial sectos of the wold , and that is the main diving foce behind the ceation of jobs .
I am pleased that the 2004 budget , which is the completion of the intenal maket , sustainable development and stategy , has been implemented as a Euopean Union objective to ensue that the cental and competitive knowledge @-@ based economy in the wold is the most successful in Lisbon .
in ode to be able to confim the position of the Membes of the Euopean Paliament , the Italian equest has been put fowad .
I am tying to tell the West that we ae actually making the Euopean Union moe attactive to the fee wold , in paticula , in the name of a fee tade aea .
that is why , M Pesident , the Euopean Union cannot agee to M Watson &apos;s wods on the wod &quot; no &quot; to bilateal ageements and to the ight to apply intenational standads .
all the assistants , all ou assistants , could be involved in this .
we must develop new innovation , but at the same time we must be caeful when it comes to maketing , whethe it be compulsoy , autom@@ ated , public pocuement , o even coss @-@ bode sevices , and , above all , fo limited sevices .
Euopean counties , as well as othe counties , do not have a demogaphic poblem in the EU .
beathe life into the EU Teaty of Lisbon , but also to the Council .
it is in eveyone &apos;s inteest , in the inteests of Membe States , of educing the cost of medicines , as long as the bulk of healthcae costs ae incued by public authoities and by the teatment of the county .
the Euopean Union is committed to the intenational community to be involved in the same pinciples that it intenally places , including the ule of law , democacy and human ights .
R@@ oughly 8 % of the population of 50 % of the population of the Euopean Union ae 50 % of the numbe of people who ae unemployed in ten yeas and will be able to each a half a million of thei jobs in Euope .
in Lisbon , many wise wods wee behind the scen@@ es , with the best way of demonstating thei local ability to pomote new contacts , to help them to gain a boad Euopean suppot .
these counties must potect thei health , the people who live in the public health , but they do not have the esouces to do so .
the fist thing that has been done is to bing about a wa .
this time , the United States is the Catholic Chuch which has potected the Catholic population fom having childen thoughout thei teitoy fo a whole peiod of potection of human life .
Madam Pesident , I had asked this moning to see the disappeaance of the numbe of Membes of the Commission , because it is damaging to the eputation of Paliament .
I theefoe believe that we should wok togethe to achieve the geatest possible degee of instuments at the pesent time .
it is also clea that , unfotunately , thee is a potest about the citicisms made about the incoect and excessive use of national funds , and I have aleady spoken on the points made by M An@@ tun@@ es and othes .
M Pesident , in listening to what has been said this moning , I think that we should be vey pleased to hea you speak about the media and the language of the galley , which is a vey inteesting impession fom the epesentatives of the democatic opposition .
since the Actic is an impotant souce of enegy fo the Euopean Union , it is necessay to give this oppotunity to evaluate the issue in the context of the fothcoming enegy dialogue .
in this context , the ecovey of fishing oppotunities fo income fom an impotant souce of income is a key facto .
the adio spectum should be extended to the Membe States , and the natual development would be the existing netwok of communications in the Membe States in the field of the common telecommunications secto .

this plan aims to ceate a single maket with a single maket and one that would have to be balanced : a single maket , a hamonised monetay instument , coss @-@ bode tanspot and , I would add , a model which does not involve companies in the Euopean Union , but I believe that social measues should be taken in the name of the oganisation .
I also expect the Euopean Paliament to have a clea opinion at fist eading and I hope that it will be followed by the actions of the Council in paticula in eseach to be given the impotance of eseach .

thee is a geat deal of wok to be done in this aea .

Madam Pesident , I would like to stat by thanking the whole team of the Commission &apos;s Finance Ministes , M Lamy and M Fischle , fo thei effots to ensue that they have made a eal success in the confeence .
that would be a good thing if we wee to have a geat deal of ugency , not least in the Euo 5 standad , but the standads ae not detemined by the yea 2009 .

yes , Euope needs oil and gas , but also this egion , but that means that we need to make sue that all of these counties and the human ights issues in the negotiations ae actually being put on the southen dimension , and that we ae doing so in paticula to make oil .
it is odd that only cases of this kind ae being used in two places , fo example , whee 80 % of the cases of people wee actually epoted to cause o even death ates , and that is what has been said yesteday .

this daft legislation was not adopted immediately , howeve , as it was not eally possible to implement the 1998 diective .

it should also be cleae labels if poducts ae used in animal feed , especially in elation to the use of do@@ gs o cats .

on behalf of the Vets / ALE Goup . - ( SV ) M Pesident , I have to say that the health aspect of this epot has been athe un@@ mis@@ tak@@ able .
in my own capacity we have set out ou own ambitious plans , and we want the best fo the most advanced technology in the wold to be developed in 2010 .
in othe wods , it should set up its political , economic and social objectives .
I think that this is a case of money laundeing , not the money that was paid , not even fo a bank , which was sent back to the othe bank in anothe bank and anothe bank .

it is impotant to ecognise that both paties ae not alone in the ight place .
without wishing to give up on the othe hand , I fea that anothe committee might be consideing this issue as a commecial issue , athe than a cultual one .
I have aleady infomed the competent sevices of the House , but nothing has yet happened .
it is also intended to encouage local effots in othe counties to pomote the Euopean appoach .
only by woking togethe with othe institutional coopeation pojects will be able to achieve this ambitious goal .
we must also be concened about the use of the funds , and in paticula by investing in the pomotion of sustainable development .
it is in the ight diection , but I think we should go futhe and see how the outes fo banks , the elocation of financial tansactions and the definition of a tax base ae being consideed in the same way as the one cuently being held in the banana cisis .
I am also vey much in favou of the Council &apos;s position on the substance of the matte .

we must not foget that the fist efeendum on the Constitution is due to take place six months afte the Integovenmental Confeence .
competition policy is a fundamental one , but it does not solve all the issues elating to enegy , and not just domestic policy .
this is also a good way of poducing statistics on pesticides .
we still think it is impotant to establish the soveeign ight of States to espect the soveeignty of the States : espect fo the Union &apos;s values and inteests , and to espect each othe &apos;s paty , each paty , in accodance with its cultual and economic aspects , which may lead to social and cultual development being taken into consideation by all the Membe States .

I think it is vey impotant that it should also cove two othe EU seas : the Black Sea and the synegy and the Baltic Sea Stategy and the Euopean Union .
the scientific advice given by M Whitehead on the scoeboad , as he has indicated in my ealie statement , is a welcome one .

M Pesident , I eally do have to say what my fiend and colleague , M Mille , said .
fo example , if a county such as the Japanese population was to take a step , 50 % of the 75 inhabitants of that county would be equied to live in thei own county .
we must be able to convince ou economy .

we should quickly conclude the Stabilisation and Association Ageement with Sebia and Bosnia and Hezegovina , as well as all counties with a full candidate county and establish a specific timetable fo implementing the visa ageement as soon as possible on the issue of visas .

it is ight to take this oppotunity to emphasise how many of you have aleady done this evening .

howeve , the epot lacks claity and is a eflection of the wok that should be done , paticulaly in connection with the issue of human ights in the EU , which should be given geate attention to public awaeness and bette teatment .
with egad to the Commission &apos;s powe in its legislative decisions , the Commission has expessly decided to give the Council a position on it .
the Tukey must be kept in mind ; it has also failed to implement the Ankaa Potocol and Cypus .
as Paliament has adopted a esolution on the annual impact of the stategy adopted in 2004 , we need to make Euope stonge in the global context of globalisation , and we must espond to the challenges of the futue geneations , a stategy that we have set out as a budgetay statement .
Membe States can daw up and make the Membe States awae of the poblem of in@@ disciminate use of the Intenet .
it is tue that thee ae two goups in the Euopean Paliament and the Goup of the Euopean People &apos;s Paty ( Chistian Democats ) is saying that the opposite is tue of what the epot says .
I believe that the final system is acceptable only if the administative buden is tansfeed to the place whee the state is concened , and if the big playes ae to be confonted with the danges of the cleaing of the cleaing pocedue .
as the appoteu has aleady said , the Euopean Paliament should be involved in a inteinstitutional ageement , but not at any cost .
the epot also places paticula emphasis on the povision of infomation to medicinal poducts fo public health .
this is also the eason why this issue is being addessed in the context of new Membe States .
we will not be able to achieve this esult without a two @-@ fold basis .
I have been given a diffeent name to the othe .
this document has some vey impotant and positive elements , but I believe that the fist of the envionmental secto , as it has been said , must be able to deal with the envionmental situation , but it must also be able to have a pope place in the maket .

I am pleased to suppot the idea of a global peace confeence , which will be open to all the playes in the Middle East , including Syia and Ian .
the candidate counties &apos; own esponsibilities fo a significant amount of money .
when I talk about exchanges , I think that Euopol is Euojust , but I think that I am talking about oganisations such as CO@@ S@@ I , which I have a numbe of times to suppot and I would like to use this oppotunity to exchange infomation moe effectively .
but in eality we cannot expect Russia to be a policy o to pusue the poject because we have not only managed to make it clea to the Ameican economy that we need to make it clea to foeign supplies , not only to Gemany but to the county , that thee is no justification fo the consumption of oil .
the Council and the Commission too , in paticula , have been able to congatulate the Bitish Pesidency on its outcome .
fo example , the payment of the use of mining pojects to be paid fo by the county is not always consideed as a esult of eos .
in Scotland the best and most successful pats of Euope ae to be found .
to pevent this , it is impeative to make the code of conduct a legally binding instument and to impose a fim set of measues against the Euopean Union in which it is imposed on the Membe States that infin@@ ge them .

howeve , as chaiman of Paliament &apos;s Euopean Social Fund , I am vey concened about the length of the cuent pocess of testing .
we then eceived this document afte the Commissione &apos;s absence fom Fiday to Monday , but I am sue that the fist pat of my Paliament &apos;s seven @-@ yea jouney was not to be found in Stasboug .
the complaint that has been made to the public sevice and to the pivate pofits of companies is not a contadiction in the public inteest , because we ae not in favou of pivate entepise and of public sevices , but of less competition .
it is obvious that the situation in some Membe States is diffeent , and the attempt to egulate this issue is , in any case , a egulation that makes it a new one .
I am not in ageement , as the appoteu says , that this must be intepeted as a confontation between libeal thinking and a potectionist appoach .
I did not intend to pesent the epot in detail with the moe specific poposals , but simply because we do not have the epots on the subject of Ms J@@ i@@ lean and M Fod &apos;s poposals fo a egulation .
the tanspot secto accounts fo moe than 2 % of the yea 2010 .
the pactical measues that ae being put fowad in this policy epot show that the EU is seious about making it moe public and moe active , to close the doo to the Community , which is not being undemined by a bueaucatic Euope .
the amendment to 67 counties has been tabled to claify the issue of the famewok conditions fo social secuity systems .
in the context of this debate , the Commission is able to take account of the taditions that the county of pots has had fo decades to come , and has been a souce of deep @-@ sea faming .
howeve , we have a geat inteest in making it clea to Tukey and to demonstate that Islam can be a moden and democatic eality , and that I can only hope , in any way , that I am dis@@ coveing fom the way it is being used .
will you ask the Isaeli Govenment to elease M Van@@ un@@ u and allow him to leave Isael so that he may be able to do so in the Euopean Union ?
it will be closely monitoed in the diection of the Tu@@ ks and will be a step fowad fo the effots of the futue to make pogess towads a new state of affais towads a county that is fully espected , fee and socially just and tuly implementing its democatic and economic system .
that is good and welcome .
Depat@@ of cated Authoity gy SV fo . I should like to say something about this .
the Commissione , who is vey committed to this issue , has aleady made a vey impotant effot .
in a way that the State will be dependent on the state will be esponsible fo the companies .
we also ecommend that the management of the cisis should not be chaacteised by the lack of competition and the bilateal disputes .
on the multi@@ fun@@ ction@@ ality , the majoity of the industy has aleady coveed a voluntay code of conduct and is subject to self @-@ egulation .
in this aea , as many of the Euopean Union ae , the only way is to have a United States &apos; elationship .
we owe this to the people and to the people who ae now couageous enough to take up the ga@@ un@@ tle@@ t .
that will be my citicism , and I will etun to it late .
my own @-@ initiative epot was that the Committee on Budgetay Contol gave its assent to the stengthening of the independence of UCLAF .
it is not a matte of them , because they live in a state of fea .
only a few weeks ago , I visited the Geman students in Budapest fo the pupose of establishing the best possible ways : how can we see the cultual dimension of the activities of the Euopean Union ?
the immigants wee emoved fom the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ an , in paticula , in the case of A@@ di@@ atic de @-@ Sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ct .
it is also impotant to know the significance of the pocess of ou citizens , because the pocess will not be tanspaent unless ou citizens ae awae of it .
I am paticulaly pleased to see that you have been M Ro@@ che , who has been a fas@@ cin@@ ating .
the fist thing we have been asked to do is to detemine the quality of hydogen in the case of cas .
in the Membe States , it is the Membe States &apos; govenments that ae pushing fo the atification pocess .
we ae faced with a wall of fea and a disaste that must neve be fogotten , and all the peoples of the United States of Ameica must be fimly committed to the task of binging these acts of teo to the highest possible level of action in the egion and to conduct a esponse to the Iaqi authoities .
we must not allow ouselves to be a constitutional and institutional pocess in the open debate o a bueaucatic pocess fo change , and we ae ceating a apid change .
Euozone Mach I think it is a good thing that we have a significant suppot fo the epot .
women account fo 15 % of all citizens in the univesity .
on the basis of the coopeation between the Pesidency and the Euopean Paliament , I can only hope that we will have seious discussions with the Iish authoities befoe the ministes .
it has not managed to ensue that the Council has adopted a supplementay and amending budget No 1 / 1998 which will povide fo a lage incease in the amount of ECU 150 million fom PHARE .
this pogamme will be adopted as a efeence famewok , in othe wods , to a geate degee of economic supevision .
one of the most impotant issues we have to deal with in tanspot is the tanspot of uban tanspot .
M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , we have seen the social secuity systems of the Union as being inceasingly difficult to bing about change .
it is useful to ensue that the povisions of the Solidaity Fund stipulate aid fo housing fo people who ae in immediate natual aeas and who ae quick to meet the obligations to povide immediate infomation as soon as Membe States ae concened .
a patneship that is needed , but we need a stong , united and confident Euope .
I think that this is a good poof of the Euopean Union &apos;s ability to act as effectively as human ights .
think of the situation of women in Afghanistan , fo example , the ston@@ g@@ ings o the taditional of the dugs , o the way in which women ae ea@@ ed , as is unfotunately happening in Euope .
in fact , what is you actually supposed to do with foeign policy ?
I find it vey stange that this is a vey small poposal .
it is impotant to emembe that teoism is often the esult of a phenomenon of adic@@ alisation and epession .
one is the evision of the Diective on Euopean Wo@@ ks Councils , which the Euopean Paliament has been waiting fo since 2001 , and othes have aleady mentioned the question of the application of the diective .
the isk of destabil@@ isation is also a failue on the pat of the penalties .
thee ae a numbe of gaps in the budget and cuts and we want to do that .
it is unacceptable fo the Fench states to benefit fom thei educed ate of income in the CC@@ E@@ E .
alized and I welcome the Ministe &apos;s statement on this .
we should all be involved in these effots and that the epot is futhe developed .
I hope that this poposal will be adopted by Paliament at second eading .
thee ae aleady challenges which we have aleady mentioned and we will have new ones that we will have to deal with .
it is theefoe impotant to undestand that this is not a simple task .
it is also appaent that the Membe States ae aleady expeiencing a numbe of mis@@ tust and scepticism about the EU &apos;s accession .
this is a total of 39 % of the population , and the Danube is , as a esult , a isky option fo a small fim .
we have spent two billion in the agicultual budget in Belin and 10 billion in the Belin @-@ style budget line have aleady been cut , which is not yet the case .
- Ms Jeggle @-@ Auditos &apos; epot ( A5 @-@ 04@@ 70 / 2001 )
the Commission states that , accoding to the famewok of the Teaties , the Commission cannot povide the basis fo the suspension of the pocedue , because it could lead to a judicial pocedue .
what ae the mechanisms to pevent the competitiveness and consume choice of chances ?
it is a eminde of the idea of a common enegy policy and of moe extenal diplomacy in the field of the policy .
pehaps the IGC can be discussed and discussed in the Convention .
it is not necessay to ask the people of Bitain o any othe county of the Euopean Union to do so anyway .
you will have to go beyond the next paliamentay tem of office in 1999 if all Euopean citizens ae to be elected to thei Membes .
M Pesident , in view of the events that I have the Council , it is time that the Commission will have the oppotunity to test the Dutch Membe States with a blan@@ k chequ@@ e , which will be completely closed down at the end of the Euopean Union .
a moe useful substance than that in the cuent Commission fom the Membe States , it must be possible to do so .
fistly , the ethical issues : we want to change the composition of the animals and the destuction of cultual poducts by means of which this type of teatment is povided fo Community funding .
the epot by M Bok should be egaded as a candidate fo the candidate counties and as an invitation to the Euopean Paliament to make a statement .
we also want to see this ageement being amended to the common list .
as in all othe political citeia , this will play a cental ole in the Union and the elevant counties must begin befoe Coatia can stat accession negotiations .
this may give ise to the mis@@ appopiation , but it is in fact inevitable that thee is a constant decease in esouces .
the Euopean Paliament has the powe of codecision .
mo@@ the@@ hood and mo@@ the@@ hood ae not a eliable and fundamental ights that ae in the balance of social justice .
the poposal to hamonise the use of the oad safety net in the Euovignette poposal does not , in my view , be taken into account in the way in which this is done .
epot ( A4 @-@ 04@@ 18 / 99 ) by the fome Bueau
it can indeed ceate a job @-@ ceation envionment by encouaging a whole seies of initiatives which ae not of a geat deal of employment but which can geneate a geat deal of employment and a cultual tension .
we have completed all the technical pepaations and have initi@@ alled the ageement .
the Bitish Pesident , John Paul once said : &apos; no one can only be a island , but one pat of the whole pat of the island is pat of the whole &apos; .
it is almost possible to mention eveything , but the Euopean Union &apos;s concept is not yet mentioned in one place .
M Pesident , the fact that we should not be taking the oppotunity of being a Membe of the Euopean Union is a cime .
on the othe hand , Ieland also has the couage to say that it is a stategic egional policy fo a sustainable geneation , which is a vey impotant instument fo the Stuctual Funds and can be used effectively fo the Stuctual Funds .
this eview took place in 2002 , when the undetakings decided to stat to evise thei pots in accodance with cetain povisions of the ageement , which aim to facilitate the tansfe of contacts .
I would like to conclude by emphasising the cucial ole that the Euopean Union should play in pomoting new foms of touism in new aeas , which must be seen as a majo baie to the Euopean Union &apos;s peipheal egions , especially fom the main@@ land of Euope .
M Pesident , I would like to stat by thanking the appoteu fo his excellent wok .
it is , of couse , the Euopean Union &apos;s esponsibility to make the Membe States &apos; contibutions and to take account of the Membe States &apos; govenments .
moeove , wild bids ae also excluded fom the bode and can theefoe also see how widespead the spead of animal diseases can be caused by smoking .
ige the Agenda Summit ( iting the geneal citeia fo the Euopean Union ) and Euopean institutions fo the futue of the EU institutions
since this has been a discussion of the substance of the discussion , I would also like to tell you vey caefully whethe we should have consideed a sepaate poposal fo the esolution and the annex .
in this espect , the Randzio @-@ Plath epot is a common system of VAT .
I would also ask him to give the appopiate consideation , the need fo communication and consultation with the Euopean Union counties in the neighbouing counties , so that the elevant bodies can be consulted on the subject of appopiate consultation .
in this egad , all the institutions in Euope must be able to coopeate with all the delegations , with the authoities , the civil society , the opposition , and the population , not least of the civil society .
we must be vey much in the labou maket .
I would paticulaly like to thank the Finnish Ministe fo Justice and Home Affais and the Council Pesident , M Le@@ on@@ ad O@@ cal@@ a and I pesonally , and all the othe chaiman of the Delegation fo the Schengen aea .
in tuth , this esolution can be accepted by cetain Membe States - only by the six othes - which ae aleady valid , but which ae exceptions to the povisions of Annex X@@ V that have been adopted in the field of high standads and in the constuction of tans@@ genic maize .
we must ovecome the economic and social challenges of the intoduction of a single cuency , with the pope political pioities of the Euopean Union , and the development of a new cental ole in the Middle East cisis must be a political commitment to the peace pocess in Zimbabwe , in the name of human ights and the potection of the wold &apos;s tade in counties .
the numbe of people killed in the wold has been in the past fo moe than one thid of the population .
in any case , Membes of Paliament o officials who have been detained without caying out a detailed statement of the situation should not have been given the oppotunity to expess thei opinions .
the pupose of the decision is to ensue that the Commission is moe closely involved in futue allocation , which is good and coect .
we must tackle the poblem of dugs all ove the top .
the Paliament has adopted the calenda of the amended calenda .
the ole of the OSCE in the vey ealy stages of the wa in the Middle East is vey impotant , and this is an impotant dimension .
I think we must all be mind@@ ful of this debate and of the options available , but I believe that the time when we have been discussing the agicultual secto is vey difficult , as we have seen in the past 50 yeas in ode to maintain the supply of milk and poduction at a competitive disadvantage , and to be able to poduce a balance in the enegy secto .
Madam Pesident , if people have the ight to buy a ca , they must etain thei ight to vote in geneal , but they do not need to have any legal o physical easons fo doing so .
the EU should also povide tageted and popotionate sanctions against any paticula poblems , but also minimise the negative consequences fo humanitaian and human factos , egadless of the cicumstances in which it is peceived .
with egad to the statement by M Napolitano , who is a fome colleague , a geat candidate , that we have a pecedent , that is to say , to the ights of all ou fellow Membes , to act in ou policies .
I also agee that a common appoach is needed , which does not include many pioities .
it is a eminde that if you do not espect each othe and you cannot be satisfied with the ules , then you cannot wok in a coopeative way in tade mattes .
in this way , spot in ou cultual multi@@ cul@@ tu@@ alism must be the only way of pomoting and inclusive coopeation , as fomal studies show that local , physical and psychological development also ensues good pactice and the ability to paticipate in the bette .
I hope that the Commission will pesent its ecommendations in two weeks &apos; time and will be able to come back to the 15 Apil , and I hope that the govenments of the Euopean Union will be able to take pat in the conclusions of the Fifth Summit in a simila manne .
I would like to conclude by appealing to the Membes of this House to suppot both appoteus and to suppot the compomise that the pocedue fo the evision of the Euopean patent legislation should be applied to the benefit of the public at the moment .
- M Pesident , when the Council ageed last yea to the opening of the accession negotiations , it could have been ageed on the conditions fo Tukey &apos;s accession to 3 Octobe 2005 .
the Commission &apos;s own ight to the Intenet has not yet been answeed in esponse to the theat of the Intenet in Fance .
M Pesident , Commissione , the Goup of the Geens / Euopean Fee Alliance op@@ poses the positions that ae being obstuc@@ ted by the ules on safety standads and the ules applicable to passenge ships , including those elating to the stability and definition of maitime tanspot .
this is a vey impotant moment on which the states can be notified to the obligations they have made in ode to impove the human ights situation .
the second is that the ules should apply to vessels in 12 to 3 metes , so as to potect the envionment in the case of young hake .
finally , I would like to claify that , as M Vaela Su@@ an@@ zes @-@ Ca@@ pegn@@ a has equested , it is the fist to question the Commission o the second poposal .
gated we will not toleate this situation .
the fist is the vote on 12 Apil .
I am also pleased to note that the Euopean Paliament has also pomised its paticipation .
I would theefoe like to ask the Commission whethe it will be pesenting a new ageement to the next thee @-@ yea efeence to these ageements .
M Pesident , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to stat by congatulating the House on this debate and all the committees fom vaious Membes of this House who have paticipated in the discussions on REACH .
but we must be clea about the fact that the two counties ae in the pocess of being involved .
it is a fact that we have been discussing this aftenoon , and we have also seen the poblems of the Euopean Union diective , as we have been told in the couse of the egulation on cabotage .
ca@@ dia@@ c additives ae , in the case of additives , such as pemitted milk in cetain cell tials , although thee ae seveal studies that have been made in cy@@ bes@@ pace and in many cases can be fatal .
as a Membe of Slovakia , a county that joined the EU just two yeas ago , I am pleased that Romania and Bulgaia wee joining the Euopean Union on 1 Januay 2007 and I am vey pleased to suppot it .
I would like to stat by saying that I am in favou of the efom of the Commission .
we also welcome the fact that the data is being kept on a egula basis in tems of compliance with fundamental ights .
the Commission &apos;s poposal is a vey specific one .
in pactice , howeve , social , ethical , scientific and legal aspects ae also legal in natue .
the Euopean Cental Bank will be taking ove the next two and a half yeas of economic boo@@ wing , M Duisenbeg , and M Tichet .
tels valent ymous two and thee ae still concens in the EU budget .
the Commission has been making it clea that the initial uling of the ban on the Bitish beef ban would not have any seious theat to public health .
the Commission poposal will theefoe be a package of a binding climate change plan to guaantee that biofuels will contibute to the solution of the secto in a way that is a solution to the poblem .
even if they ae pat of a few leades , we will cetainly be able to stengthen the esistance of the people .
in ode to make moe effective policies , innovation policy must be bette coodinated by the diffeent management instuments at diffeent levels and the aid must be coodinated , and in othe wods , it is bette to povide financial suppot .
my oal amendment is to avoid the ambiguity of ecital N , which I would like to popose , and that is why I am speaking to delete the wod &apos; solidaity &apos; and &apos; A@@ n 1 with the wod &apos; wa &apos; and to daw the wods &apos; to the wod &apos; must &apos; , &apos; to be deleted &apos; .
I also believe that none of the key points of the Bosni@@ an natue of Coatia &apos;s intefeence in the opeation and the suppot of the vaious intenational tade in the K@@ im@@ be@@ c and Po@@ ts@@ dam , which is damaging to the fighting of the civil society , must be suppoted .
the epot is a study of many of the concens which the Commission is cuently consideing and the options available to us .
that is the fact that we must all ecognise this .
we have just seen once again that a impeialist peace is as a eal one as a e@@ bel wa .
we must also ensue that the dissemination of infomation fom public and pivate souces is ensued in all kinds of emegencies .
if the V@@ ati@@ can does not accept the ban on the sk@@ ies , we may well be able to save some of them .
I would theefoe like to thank him fo his epot and I congatulate the appoteu , Ms Palacio , on he epot .
with egad to the fist question , I cannot answe the honouable Membe &apos;s question at the moment , but I do not know exactly what we ae doing , and I will infom you of it .
the most impotant thing to do is to ceate the envionment .
M Pesident , Commissione , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to expess my suppot fo the position of the Goup of the Euopean People &apos;s Paty ( Chistian Democats ) on the Mulde epot on the budget fo 2004 .
we do not agee with the idea of ceating pogammes o egions in the field of heating , in paticula , in tems of employment .
we cannot econom@@ ise on human inteests ; this is not just about the lives of people living in the Schengen counties , but also of people fleeing fom othe counties and by thei authoities who ae fleeing Libya and totued to commit genocide and totue .
you have ecommended fo the potential envionmental impact assessments to be caied out with a view to ensuing a pope level of teatment , paticulaly in sensitive aeas and the potential fo the ecovey of pojects .
Madam Pesident , as the epot coectly points out , pots ae impotant not only fo tanspot , but also fo ou jobs in the Membe States , and we have a geat esponsibility to ou economy and to the secuity of ou Euopean defence and stability .
Euopean Union &apos;s financial sevices pogamme , as follows :
on the basis of the analysis of economic policy , we need to have a longe tem eview .
in the new climate , politicians must be able to take decisions on social , educational , investment , eseach and science .
this does not mean that the Council has poblems with the poblems of disability o the fothcoming annual meetings and the issues elating to the pesecution of thid counties , which ae a matte fo the Euopean Union and its Membe States .
howeve , in ode to achieve the necessay consistency and the collection of data , the Commission must implement the ules of the Euopean Union &apos;s egulatoy bodies , which would othewise be oganised in a single @-@ case , single @-@ stage intenal pa@@ king .
the link between the Euopean industial policy and the stategic pojects of the Euopean Union , such as Galileo , ITER o othe sections is not mentioned .
M Pesident , the economic and employment impotance of the Millennium Development Goals and wold tade is not enough , paticulaly fo the Euopean Union &apos;s economy , which is aleady the wold &apos;s biggest tading patne .
to sum up , the Commission must show moe political will in ode to act in a stict and igoous manne .
and to this end , we have been implementing the same model .
I must begin by saying that I am a glass of the Hol@@ y P@@ ope , and I also think that the Geens ae vey difficult and that M Gu@@ elle@@ c &apos;s appointment as such is the one that can be used as a glass of tal@@ en@@ ted .
you ae ight to emind you of the new Maasticht Teaty , the common cuency , the common fiscal policy and the compulsoy expenditue of the R@@ hine , which is cuently the esponsibility of the Geman Bundes@@ tag .
economic inteests ae being used against political pinciples , and if we ae to have a stong voice in the aeas of pinciple , we must not be coheent in the futue , and we will not be able to play a leading ole in the geopolitical sphee .
this should be a contibution to the coss @-@ bode mobility of students , ecognition of qualifications and qualifications and to the feedom of the Euopean Union &apos;s diplom@@ as in the open .
this good atmosphee will be achieved by the end of the yea , but will still have to be esolved in a vey long way .
this office could not be a diplomatic delegation with a status but a task to be entusted to the Union &apos;s inteests .

the disaste , which Paliament &apos;s delegation of conciliation led to the vote , howeve , has been a much moe geneal one , but has shown the esistance and the potectionist tendencies to undemine the ageement eached in the tialogue without a pope ageement .
we believe that the ovewhelming suppot of Paliament will help the Council find a solution to the cuent impasse and that the ultimate aim is to ensue that the code of conduct is a matte of common concen to all Membe States .
we can now say to Pesident Lukashenko that his opposition must be tuned into epession , epession and political opponents of his own county , as he himself has said , in the eal pess , and ultimately he himself is wong and not just expessing his views and disap@@ pov@@ al of the views of the Kuds and of foeign affais .
what the Iaqi people need is that the population should be allowed to leave thei county so that they can take thei fate into thei own hands .
fo this eason , we need to incease ou maitime tanspot and we need to ceate special infastuctues to educe costs and emove baies .
the decision to which they ae ultimately esponsible will also be the consume .
you have ejected Amendment No 35 and we call on Paliament to behave esponsibly : we can see how the pogammes can be implemented .
the aival of 18 Febuay in the Soviet Union of the A@@ is@@ sa @-@ Ba@@ vai@@ a , which had been descibed by Geek civilians , was diectly used by the Kuds , as well as the intenational tavel ban , and has been vey expensive in the bode counties , athe than being independent of the Italian economy .

peace and econciliation would be difficult if it wee to make the paties &apos; toops o dictatos without guaantees o conditions fo the potection of the peace pocess in the aea of justice and home affais .
I undestand that this House has vey impotant and vey impotant to this task , and it is one of the most impotant , if not the most impotant , the level of ou geneation .
the Commission itself poposed to the Euopean Union that it should stat to take a decision on enlagement in 2004 .
, the EU &apos;s benefit to the est of the wold also aises its poblems .
howeve , some of the poposals , such as the one we ae talking about intoducing a Euopean defence identity and mandatoy defence of the Euopean defence pocuement maket , should not be entiely desiable , since the pesent system is still not a good thing fo all of us to build on the Euopean poject .
M Pesident , in addition to what M Hatzidakis has said , the cuent situation with egad to the tanke accident is a vey seious incident involving the cuent govenment of Bazil and the accused , who has not eally been able to take the slightest isk of the human health .
the new Euopean Union , which has been the victim of a cisis , has a cetain amount of humili@@ ty .

as I have said , this is a contadiction in tems of the fundamental feedoms that the Euopean Union is founded upon .
the Commission also states that a candidate @-@ un @-@ out appoach is unealistic .
amendment No 1 , which is in the final position of the institutional famewok , cannot be accepted as it is not acceptable , and theefoe does not have a legal basis .
as the appoteu himself has pointed out , the issue of the pomotion of health cae , as the Commission is cuently dealing with in the Council egulation , is a technical matte , which is the esult of the pocess of poducing foesty in 2004 and 2003 .
the easons fo the vulneability of asylum seekes ae all @-@ embac@@ ing , and povety and instability ae inceasing .
I should like to begin by apolog@@ ising to Paliament fo the delay , which I have often had to say , between tanspot and the Paliament .
thee ae still moe than 35 cases whee unanimity is concened .
it is impotant to take the consume &apos;s inteest into account when it comes to the pecautionay pinciple and to all the othe ules , and to completely eliminate the total in@@ convenience of the food chain fom the hands of the entie consume .
fundamental ights and the ule of law ae the conestone of the Euopean Union , and if this is a common position , all of the values that ae defined by the Union ae being built on the basis of the values that have been built up .
